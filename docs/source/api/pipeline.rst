Pipeline
========

Save/Load
=========

FEDOT provides methods for saving and loading pipelines in the ``Pipeline`` class:

- `save <https://github.com/aimclub/FEDOT/blob/master/fedot/core/pipelines/pipeline.py#L241>`_
    This method saves the pipeline to JSON representation with pickled fitted operations and preprocessing if there are any.

    There are five ways to save pipeline:
        1. With ``create_subdir=True`` and ``is_datetime_in_path=True``

           An additional folder will be created inside the specified directory.
           The folder and name of JSON file with pipeline will contain timestamp.

        2. With ``create_subdir=True`` and ``is_datetime_in_path=False``

           An additional folder will be created inside the specified directory.
           The folder and name of JSON file with pipeline will contain pipeline autoincrement index.
           The index is calculated based on the number of already saved pipelines in this directory.
           For example, if there are no saved pipelines in specified directory, than current pipeline
           will be saved as ``0_pipeline_saved.json`` in ``0_pipeline_saved`` subdir.
           This option is useful for pipelines with fitted_operations&preprocessing.

        3. With ``create_subdir=False`` and ``is_datetime_in_path=True``

           Pipeline will be saved exactly in specified dir.
           The folder and name of JSON file with pipeline will contain timestamp.
           This option is useful for pipelines without fitted_operations&preprocessing.

        4. With ``create_subdir=False`` and ``is_datetime_in_path=False``

           Pipeline will be saved exactly in specified dir.
           The name of JSON file with pipeline will be the same as the last folder in the path.
           For example, if ``C:\path\to\my\pipeline`` path was specified, than pipeline will be saved in
           ``C:\path\to\my\pipeline\pipeline.json``.
           This option is useful for pipelines without fitted_operations&preprocessing
           and when it's important to know the exact name of pipeline file.

        5. With JSON file name in path

           For example, if path specified like this ``C:\path\to\my\pipeline\pipeline.json``,
           than pipeline will be saved exactly to this file. Fitted_operations&preprocessing will be saved in
           ``C:\path\to\my\pipeline\`` it there are any.
           Other args as ``create_subdir`` and ``is_datetime_in_path`` do not matter in this option.
           This option is useful for pipelines without fitted_operations&preprocessing
           and when it's important to know the exact name of pipeline file.


- `load <https://github.com/aimclub/FEDOT/blob/master/fedot/core/pipelines/pipeline.py#L263>`_
    Loads the pipeline ``JSON`` representation with pickled fitted operations.

    There two ways to load pipeline:
        1. To specify path to pipeline dir

            For example, if pipeline was saved to ``C:\FEDOT\saved\2022-11-16_15-53-49_pipeline_saved\2022-11-16_15-53-49_pipeline_saved.json``
            than path to load pipeline must be specified as ``C:\FEDOT\saved\2022-11-16_15-53-49_pipeline_saved``.
            Fitted_operations&preprocessing will be loaded automatically if there is any.

            NB. You can use the same path without modification to load pipeline only if it was saved in 3, 4 or 5 way.
            This is due to the fact that with such saving options it is known exactly in which folder JSON file with the pipeline was saved.

        2. To specify path to JSON file with pipeline

            For example, if pipeline was saved to ``C:\FEDOT\saved\2022-11-16_15-53-49_pipeline_saved\2022-11-16_15-53-49_pipeline_saved.json``
            than path to load pipeline must be specified as ``C:\FEDOT\saved\2022-11-16_15-53-49_pipeline_saved\2022-11-16_15-53-49_pipeline_saved.json``.
            Fitted_operations&preprocessing will be loaded automatically if there is any.


Examples
~~~~~~~~

Saving options :

.. code-block:: python

    problem = 'classification'
    train_data_path = f'{fedot_project_root()}/cases/data/scoring/scoring_train.csv'

    baseline_model = Fedot(problem=problem, timeout=1, seed=42)
    baseline_model.fit(features=train_data_path, target='target', predefined_model='rf')

    path_to_save = f'{fedot_project_root()}/saved_pipelines'

    pipeline = baseline_model.current_pipeline

    pipeline.save(path=path_to_save, create_subdir=True, is_datetime_in_path=True)

Pipeline will be saved like this:


``` root
+-- dir1
    +--file1
+-- dir2
    +-- file2
```
