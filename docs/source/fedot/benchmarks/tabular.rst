Tabular data
------------

The subset of PMLB benchmarks were evaluated for FEDOT, `TPOT <http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/>`__, `MLBox <https://github.com/AxeldeRomblay/MLBox>`__ and XGboost baseline. The results and metadata are presented below.

As we can see from the table, the results obtained during the
experiments demonstrate the advantage of composite pipeline
created by the proposed approach over competitors. The only
exception is a single case for regression and classification problems respectively, where the maximum value of the quality metric was obtained using a static pipeline.
