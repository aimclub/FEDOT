FEDOT Command Line Interface (CLI)
===================================================================

FEDOT API can be called via console without writing python code.
All API parameters can be marked as flags described in application Help.
Prediction saves as a CSV file for future use.


For correct console application run, there should be Python environment with installed
FEDOT package with all dependencies.


*Pay attention that your FEDOT working project can differ from the package version installed in the environment!*
*For setting master version as a package in environment download it through pip from GitHub with command:*

``pip install git+https://github.com/nccr-itmo/FEDOT.git``

Start using
------------------

The main executing script running the application is fedot_cli.py so first, there is a need to navigate to them:


``cd {path_to_fedot}/fedot/api``

To get a list of possible flags and their descriptions, a help call is provided:

``python fedot_cli.py --help``

The result of execution is presented below:

.. code-block:: console

Examples of using (.bat files)
------------------

Examples of usage can be presented as .bat files for console execution. These files are located at
``/examples/cli_application`` folder. There the templates of parameters for different
problems decision are presented.

The string below helps to run classification problem decision from the console:

``python --problem classification --train ../../test/data/simple_classification.csv --test ../../test/data/simple_classification.csv  --target Y --c_timeout 0.1``
