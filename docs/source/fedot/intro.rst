Intro to FEDOT
==============

FEDOT - an open-source framework for automated modeling and machine learning (AutoML). It can build custom modeling pipelines for different real-world processes in an automated way using an evolutionary approach. FEDOT supports classification (binary and multiclass), regression, clustering, and time series prediction tasks.

The framework is not limited to specific AutoML tasks (such as pre-processing of input data, feature selection, or optimization of model hyperparameters), but allows you to solve a more general structural learning problem - for a given data set, a solution is built in the form of a graph (DAG), the nodes of which are represented by ML models, pre-processing procedures, and data transformation.
