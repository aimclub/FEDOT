Time Series Forecasting
=======================

FEDOT allows you to automate machine learning pipeline design for time-series forecasting.

FEDOT extracts features using `lagged transformation`_ to apply regression methods for forecasting.
Therefore not only models specific for time-series forecasting (such as
ARIMA and AR) can be used but also any regression method (ridge, lasso, etc.).

Time-series specific preprocessing methods,
like moving average smoothing or Gaussian smoothing are used as well.

Simple examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can find all available API parameters in :class:`~fedot.api.main.Fedot` reference.

Automated
---------

Use FEDOT in automated mode to get pipeline with automatically composed architecture and tuned hyperparameters.

.. code-block:: python

    from fedot.api.main import Fedot
    from fedot.core.data.data import InputData
    from fedot.core.data.data_split import train_test_data_setup
    from fedot.core.repository.tasks import Task, TaskTypesEnum, TsForecastingParams

    # specify the task and the forecast length (required depth of forecast)
    task = Task(TaskTypesEnum.ts_forecasting,
                TsForecastingParams(forecast_length=10))

    # load data from csv
    train_input = InputData.from_csv_time_series(task=task,
                                                 file_path='time_series.csv',
                                                 delimiter=',',
                                                 target_column='value')
    # split data for train and test
    train_data, test_data = train_test_data_setup(train_input)

    # init model for the time-series forecasting
    model = Fedot(problem='ts_forecasting', task_params=task.task_params)

    # run AutoML model design
    pipeline = model.fit(train_data)
    # plot obtained pipeline
    pipeline.show()

    # use model to obtain out-of-sample forecast with one step
    forecast = model.forecast(test_data)
    print(model.get_metrics(metric_names=['rmse', 'mae', 'mape'], target=test_data.target))

    # plot forecasting result
    model.plot_prediction()

Sample output:

Here:

- polyfit - polynomial interpolation,
- lagged - `lagged transformation`_,
- ridge - ridge regression.

In the first branch polynomial interpolation is applied to obtain forecast. In the second branch
lagged transformation is used to transform time-series into table data and then ridge is applied.
Finally, another ridge model uses forecasts of two branches to generate final prediction.

Obtained metrics:

Use FEDOT in manual mode to fit your own pipeline for time-series forecasting.

Examples of time-series pipelines can be found :doc:`here</examples/ts_pipelines>`.

See how to tune pipeline hyperparameters in :doc:`/advanced/hyperparameters_tuning`.

.. code-block:: python

    from fedot.core.pipelines.pipeline_builder import PipelineBuilder
    from fedot.core.repository.tasks import Task, TaskTypesEnum, TsForecastingParams

    # compose your own pipeline
    pipeline = PipelineBuilder() \
        .add_sequence('lagged', 'ridge', branch_idx=0) \
        .add_sequence('glm', branch_idx=1).join_branches('ridge').build()

    # specify the task and the forecast length (required depth of forecast)
    task = Task(TaskTypesEnum.ts_forecasting,

.. _Time-series validation:

Time-series validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FEDOT uses in-sample forecasting for time-series validation.
While using FEDOT for forecasting you can set ``cv_folds`` parameter that sets number
of folds for cross validation of a time-series.
The size of validation sample in each fold is almost the maximum possible size and multiple of ``forecast_length``.


|ts_cv|

.. |ts_cv| image:: img_utilities/ts_forecasting/ts_cross_val.png
   :width: 80%

Train test split
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To split InputData use ``train_test_data_setup`` method.
``split_ratio`` and ``shuffle``, and ``stratify`` are ignored for time-series forecasting.

.. autofunction:: fedot.core.data.data_split.train_test_data_setup

The method uses ``forecast_length`` specified in the ``data.task``.


.. code-block:: python

    train_data, test_data = train_test_data_setup(train_input)

This approach can be used to
obtain ```test_data``` for **out-of-sample** forecast after training a model on the ```train_data```.
The resulting split:

- ``train_data.features = data.features[:-forecast_length]``
- ``train_data.target = data.target[:-forecast_length]``
- ``test_data.features = data.features[:-forecast_length]``
- ``train_data.target = data.target[-forecast_length:]``

|train_test_split|

.. |train_test_split| image:: img_utilities/ts_forecasting/train_test_split.png
   :width: 80%


.. code-block:: python

    train_data, test_data = train_test_data_setup(train_input, validation_blocks=3)

If you pass keyword argument ``validation_blocks`` train data will be prepared for **in-sample**
validation with ``validation_blocks`` number of steps. In these case:

- ``train_data.features = data.features[:-forecast_length * validation_blocks]``
- ``train_data.target = data.target[:-forecast_length * validation_blocks]``
- ``test_data.features = data.features``
- ``train_data.target = data.target[-forecast_length * validation_blocks:]``

   :width: 80%

Prediction
~~~~~~~~~~

There are two approaches to time-series forecasting: in-sample and out-of-sample.
For example, our trained model forecasts 10 values ahead and our training sample length is 100. With in-sample
forecast we will predict 10 last values of our training sample using 90 first values as prehistory.
With out-of-sample we will predict 10 future values of the training sample using the whole sample of 100 values
as prehistory.

To obtain forecast with length exceeding the forecast length (depth) model was trained for, we use iterative prediction.
For example, our trained model forecasts 10 values ahead, but we want to forecast 20 values.
With out-of-sample approach we would predict 10 values and then use those values to forecast
another 10 values. But with in-sample approach we forecast already known parts of
time-series. And after forecasting first 10 values we would use real values from time-series
to forecast next 10 values.

You can use two methods for time-series forecasting: ``Fedot.predict`` - in-sample forecast, ``Fedot.forecast`` -
out-of-sample forecast.

In-sample forecast
------------------

``Fedot.predict`` allows you to obtain iterative **in-sample** forecast with depth of ``forecast_length * validation_blocks``.
Method uses ``forecast_length`` specified in the task parameters. This method uses ``features`` as sample and gets forecast in the way
described in the picture (``validation_blocks=3``).

    # set task type and forecast length
    task = Task(TaskTypesEnum.ts_forecasting,
                TsForecastingParams(forecast_length=10))

    # load data from csv

    # split data for in-sample forecast
    train_data, test_data = train_test_data_setup(train_input, validation_blocks=3)

    # init model for the time-series forecasting
    model = Fedot(problem='ts_forecasting', task_params=task.task_params, cv_folds=2)

    # run AutoML model design
    pipeline = model.fit(train_data)

    # use model to obtain three-step in-sample forecast
    in_sample_forecast = model.predict(test_data, validation_blocks=3)

    # get metrics for the prediction
    print('Metrics for three-step in-sample forecast: ',
          model.get_metrics(metric_names=['rmse', 'mae', 'mape'], validation_blocks=3))

    # use model to obtain two-step in-sample forecast while using 3 validation blocks for fit
    in_sample_forecast = model.predict(test_data, validation_blocks=2)

    # get metrics for the prediction
    print('Metrics for two-step in-sample forecast: ',

Out-of-sample forecast
----------------------

``Fedot.forecast`` can be used to obtain out-of-sample forecast with custom forecast horizon. If
``horizon > forecast_length`` forecast is obtained iteratively using previously forecasted values to
predict next ones at each step. If ``horizon < forecast_length`` forecast is cutted according to the ``horison``.
By default ``horizon = forecast_length``.

Multivariate time-series forecasting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FEDOT allows you to forecast multivariate time-series.

Use **multi time-series approach** to forecast one time-series, while model was trained on the number of
time-series of the same variable as target.
At first, `lagged transformation`_ is applied to transform all of the time-series
to table data then regression models are used. (Using several time-series allows you
to expand training sample - after lagged transformation you get more train/target pairs).

.. code-block:: python

    from fedot.api.main import Fedot
    from fedot.core.data.data import InputData
    from fedot.core.data.data_split import train_test_data_setup
    from fedot.core.repository.tasks import Task, TaskTypesEnum, TsForecastingParams

    # name of the column with target time-series
    target = 'col_3'

    # set task type and forecast length
    task = Task(TaskTypesEnum.ts_forecasting,
                TsForecastingParams(forecast_length=20)) # forecast_length - required depth of forecast

    # load data from csv
    data = InputData.from_csv_multi_time_series(
            file_path='time_series.csv',
            task=task,
            target_column=target,
            columns_to_use=['col_1', 'col_2', 'col_3', ..., 'col_n'])

    # split data for in-sample forecast
    train_data, test_data = train_test_data_setup(data, validation_blocks=2)

    # init model for the time-series forecasting
    model = Fedot(problem='ts_forecasting',
                  task_params=task.task_params,
                  timeout=5,
                  n_jobs=-1,
                  cv_folds=2)

    # run AutoML model design
    pipeline = model.fit(train_data)
    # plot obtained pipeline
    pipeline.show()

    # use model to obtain two-step in-sample forecast
    forecast = model.predict(test_data, validation_blocks=2)
    print(model.get_metrics(metric_names=['rmse', 'mae', 'mape'],
                            target=test_data.target, validation_blocks=2))

Sample output:


Pipeline plot from the example:

|multi_ts_pipeline|

.. |multi_ts_pipeline| image:: img_utilities/ts_forecasting/multi_ts_pipeline.png
   :width: 60%

Here:

- smoothing - rolling mean,
- lagged - `lagged transformation`_,
- ridge - ridge regression.

In the first branch time-series is transformed using rolling mean,
lagged transformation is used to transform time-series into table data and then ridge is applied.
In the second branch only lagged transformation is applied before using ridge.
Finally, another ridge model uses forecasts of two branches to generate final prediction.

Obtained metric:

.. code-block:: python

    {'rmse': 0.105, 'mae': 0.087, 'mape': 0.469}

Use **multimodal approach** to forecast a time-series using several other time-series.
In this case for every time-series a *data sourse* node will be created.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd

    from fedot.api.main import Fedot
    from fedot.core.repository.tasks import TsForecastingParams
    from fedot.core.utils import fedot_project_root

    forecast_length = 10

    # load data from csv
    df_train = pd.read_csv('data_train.csv'))

    # get time-series
    ws_history = np.ravel(np.array(df_train['wind_speed']))[:200]
    ssh_history = np.ravel(np.array(df_train['sea_height']))[:200]

    # use dict as input data
    historical_data = {
        'ws': ws_history,  # additional variable
        'ssh': ssh_history,  # target variable
    }

    # init model for the time-series forecasting
    fedot = Fedot(problem='ts_forecasting',
                  task_params=TsForecastingParams(forecast_length=forecast_length),
                  timeout=10)

    # run AutoML model design
    pipeline = fedot.fit(features=historical_data,
                         target=ssh_history)  # specify target time-series

    # get in-sample forecast
    fedot.predict(historical_data)

    # get metrics
    metric = fedot.get_metrics(ssh_history[-forecast_length:])

    pipeline.show()
    fedot.plot_prediction(target='ssh')

To extract features FEDOT uses lagged transformation (windowing method) which allows to represent time-series as
trajectory matrix and apply regression methods for forecasting.
