Main Concepts
=============

The main concepts of the framework are the follows:

- **Flexibility.** FEDOT can be used to automate the construction of solutions for various problems, data types (texts, images, tables), and models;
- **Integrability.** FEDOT supports widely used ML libraries (Scikit-learn, CatBoost, XGBoost, etc.) and allows you to integrate custom ones;
- **Domains Extensibility.** Pipeline optimization algorithms are data- and task-independent, yet you can use special templates for a specific task class or data type (time series forecasting, NLP, tabular data, etc.) to increase the efficiency;
- **Versatility.** FEDOT is not limited to specific modeling tasks, for example, it can be used in ODE or PDE;
- **Hyper-Parameters Tuningability.** Hyper-parameters tuning methods are supported. Custom methods can also be integrated in FEDOT;
- **Reproducibility.** You can export the resulting pipelines in JSON format for experiment reproducibility;
- **Customizability.** FEDOT allows managing the complexity of models and thereby achieving better results;
