Also, we tested FEDOT on the results of `AMLB <https://github.com/openml/automlbenchmark>`_ benchmark.
The visualization of FEDOT (v.0.7.3) results against H2O (3.46.0.4), AutoGluon (v.1.1.0), TPOT (v.0.12.1) and LightAutoML (v.0.3.7.3)
obtained using built-in visualizations of critial difference plot from AutoMLBenchmark are provided below:

All datasets (ROC AUC and negative log loss):

.. image:: ./img_benchmarks/cd-all-1h8c-constantpredictor.png

Binary classification (ROC AUC):

.. image:: ./img_benchmarks/cd-binary-classification-1h8c-constantpredictor.png

Multiclass classification (negative logloss):

.. image:: ./img_benchmarks/cd-multiclass-classification-1h8c-constantpredictor.png

We can claim that results are statistically better that TPOT and and indistinguishable from H2O and AutoGluon.
