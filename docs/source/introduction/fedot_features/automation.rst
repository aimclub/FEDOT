Process automation
------------------

FEDOT is capable of setting its 'automation' of the tasks process by omitting some of its parameters.
For example, if you just create the FEDOT instance and call the ``fit`` method with the appropriate dataset on it,
you will have a full (but default at the same time) automation of the learning process.
