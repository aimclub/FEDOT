Process automation
------------------

FEDOT is capable of setting its 'automation rate' by omitting some of its parameters.
For example, if you just create the FEDOT instance and call the ``fit`` method with the appropriate dataset on it,
you will have a full automation of the learning process,
see :ref:`automated composing <../tutorial/composing_pipelines/automated_creation.rst>`

At the same time, if you pass some of the parameters, you will have a partial automation,
see :ref:`manual composing <../tutorial/composing_pipelines/manual_creation.rst>`
