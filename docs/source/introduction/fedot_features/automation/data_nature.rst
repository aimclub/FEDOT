Data nature
-----------

FEDOT uses specific data processing according to the source
of the input data (whether it is pandas DataFrame, or numpy array, or just a path to the dataset, etc).

Apart from that FEDOT is capable of working with multi-modal data.
It means that you can pass it different types of datasets
(tables, texts, images, etc) and it will get the information from within to work with it.
