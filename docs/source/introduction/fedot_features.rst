FEDOT Features
==============

The main features of the framework are follows:

- **Flexibility.** FEDOT is highly flexible: it can be used to automate the construction of solutions for various problems, data types, and models;
- **Integration with ML libraries.** FEDOT supports widely used ML libraries (Scikit-Learn, Catboost, Xgboost, etc.) and allows you to integrate custom ones;
- **Extensibility for new domains.** Pipeline optimization algorithms are data- and task-independent, yet you can use special templates for a specific task class or data type (time series forecasting, NLP, tabular data, etc.) to increase the efficiency;
- **No limits.** The framework is versatile and not limited to specific modeling tasks, for example, it can be use in ODE or PDE;
- **Support of hyper-parameter tuning.** Hyper-parameters tuning methods are supported. Custom methods can also be integrated in FEDOT;
- **Reproducibility.** You can export the resulting pipelines in JSON format for experiment reproducibility.

Compared to other frameworks:

- There are no limits to specific modeling tasks, therefore FEDOT claims versatility and expandability;
- Allows managing the complexity of models and thereby achieving better results.
- Allows building pipelines using different types of input data (texts, images, tables, etc.) and consisting of various models.
