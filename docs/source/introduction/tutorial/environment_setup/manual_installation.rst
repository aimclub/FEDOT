The easiest way
---------------

The simplest way to install FEDOT is using ``pip``:

.. code-block::

  $ pip install fedot

Installation with optional dependencies for image and text processing, and for DNNs:

.. code-block::

  $ pip install fedot[extra]

.. include:: activating_venv.rst

And that's it.
