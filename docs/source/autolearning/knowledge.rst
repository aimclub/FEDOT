Knowledge-enrichment in the automatic learning
==============================================

There are various approaches to automatic learning exists:

Today, the ML-based solutions often lose to solutions based on
domain-specific models. For example, a lot of physics-based problems can
be solved more efficiently with equation-based models: both data-driven
and domain-specific numerical models. Also, the simulation quality can
be increased using the hybrid approach [1]

The integration of the domain knowledge to the ML-based solutions is a
promising way to achieve a better quality of predictions, as well as the
identification of data-driven models with custom structure [2].

Also, the expert knowledge involvement allows improving the quality of
auto-generated models [3].
