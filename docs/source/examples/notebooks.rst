Notebooks
======================

Notebooks are available in our additional repositories `[Fedot examples]<https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot-examples>`_.
In this repository you can find following notebooks:

* `[Introduction to AutoML]<https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot-examples/blob/main/notebooks/latest/1_intro_to_automl.ipynb>`_
* `[Introduction to Fedot]<https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot-examples/blob/main/notebooks/latest/2_intro_to_fedot.ipynb>`_
* `[Introduction to Time Series Forecasting]<https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot-examples/blob/main/notebooks/latest/3_intro_ts_forecasting.ipynb>`_
* `[Introduction to Automated Time Series Forecasting]<https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot-examples/blob/main/notebooks/latest/4_auto_ts_forecasting.ipynb>`_
* `[Specific cases in Time Series Forecasting]<https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot-examples/blob/main/notebooks/latest/5_ts_specific_cases.ipynb>`_
* `[Using FEDOT for hybrid modeling with custom model tuning]<https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot-examples/blob/main/notebooks/latest/6_hybrid_modelling.ipynb>`_

Fedot can be used in cloud services, e.g. `[VK Cloud's ML Platform]<https://mcs.mail.ru/>`_. In the next `[repository]<https://github.com/stockblog/webinar_automl_fedot>`_
you can find notebooks, where presented work of framework in JupyterLab with MLflow:

* `[Amazon Employee Access Challenge - classification problem]<https://github.com/stockblog/webinar_automl_fedot/blob/main/FEDOT%20Tutorial%20-%20Classification.ipynb>`_
* `[Molhack AIRI - Regression problem]<https://github.com/stockblog/webinar_automl_fedot/blob/main/FEDOT%20Tutorial%20-%20Regression.ipynb>`_
* `[Wine Reviews - Multimodal classification problem]<https://github.com/stockblog/webinar_automl_fedot/blob/main/FEDOT%20Tutorial%20-%20Timeseries%20Forecasting.ipynb>`_
* `[Sea level daily - Time Series Forecasting problem]<https://github.com/stockblog/webinar_automl_fedot/blob/main/FEDOT%20Tutorial%20-%20Multimodal%20Data.ipynb>`_
