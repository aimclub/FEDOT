Notebooks
======================

Notebooks are available in our additional repositories `Fedot examples <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot-examples>`_.
This repository contains following notebooks:

* `Introduction to AutoML <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot-examples/blob/main/notebooks/latest/1_intro_to_automl.ipynb>`_
    Notebook shows the advantage of Automated Machine Learning and provides quickstart guide.

* `Introduction to Fedot <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot-examples/blob/main/notebooks/latest/2_intro_to_fedot.ipynb>`_
    Notebook contains a FEDOT's description and more detailed tutorial with core-based examples.

* `Introduction to Time Series Forecasting <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot-examples/blob/main/notebooks/latest/3_intro_ts_forecasting.ipynb>`_
    A gentle guide to Time Series Forecasting problem and its basic solutions using FEDOT.

* `Introduction to Automated Time Series Forecasting <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot-examples/blob/main/notebooks/latest/4_auto_ts_forecasting.ipynb>`_
    Advanced guide to configure FEDOT for a Time Series Forecasting problem.

* `Specific cases in Time Series Forecasting <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot-examples/blob/main/notebooks/latest/5_ts_specific_cases.ipynb>`_
    Notebook contains examples of using the advanced FEDOT's functionality both for predicting time series and for filling in gaps in them.

* `Using FEDOT for hybrid modeling with custom model tuning <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot-examples/blob/main/notebooks/latest/6_hybrid_modelling.ipynb>`_
    Notebook contains examples of custom model specification for Time Series Forecasting problem.

FEDOT can be used in cloud services, e.g. `VK Cloud's ML Platform <https://mcs.mail.ru/>`_. This `repository <https://github.com/stockblog/webinar_automl_fedot>`_
contains examples of FEDOT usage with JupyterLab and MLflow:

* `Amazon Employee Access Challenge - classification problem <https://github.com/stockblog/webinar_automl_fedot/blob/main/FEDOT%20Tutorial%20-%20Classification.ipynb>`_
* `Molhack AIRI - Regression problem <https://github.com/stockblog/webinar_automl_fedot/blob/main/FEDOT%20Tutorial%20-%20Regression.ipynb>`_
* `Wine Reviews - Multimodal classification problem <https://github.com/stockblog/webinar_automl_fedot/blob/main/FEDOT%20Tutorial%20-%20Timeseries%20Forecasting.ipynb>`_
