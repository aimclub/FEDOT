# Description of jupyter notebooks 

---

There are several folders. Each folder corresponds to version of FEDOT framework. So, in "version_02_1"
you can find tutorials for fedot==0.2.1, notebooks in "version_03" are suitable for fedot==0.3.0, etc. 

All supplementary materials for guides are placed in folders "data" (csv files for examples) 
and "jupyter_media" (plots and animations).
