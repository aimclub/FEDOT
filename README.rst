This repository contains Fedot - a framework for automated modeling and machine learning. It can build composite models for the different real-world processes in an automated way using an evolutionary approach.

Composite models - the models with heterogeneous graph-based structure, that can consist of ML models, domain-specific models, equation-based models, statistical, and even other composite models. Composite modelling allows obtaining efficient multi-scale solutions for various applied problems.

Fedot can be used for classification, regression, clustering, time series forecasting, and other similar tasks. Also, the derived solutions for other problems (e.g. bayesian generation of synthetic data) can be build using Fedot.Core.

The project is maintained by the research team of Natural Systems Simulation Lab, which is a part of the National Center for Cognitive Research of ITMO University.

Installation
============
  | git clone https://github.com/nccr-itmo/FEDOT.git
  | cd FEDOT
  | pip install -r requirements.txt

FEDOT features
==============
- The generation of high-quality variable-shaped machine learning pipelines for various tasks: binary/multiclass classification, regression, clustering, time series forecasting;
- The structural learning of composite models with different nature (hybrid, bayesian, deep learning, etc) using custom metrics;
- The seamless integration of the custom models (including domain-specific), frameworks and algorithms into pipelines;
- Benchmarking utilities that can run real-world cases (the ready-to-use examples are provided for credit scoring, sea surface height forecasting, oil production forecasting, etc), state-of-the-art-datasets (like PMLB) and synthetic data.


How to use
==========

The main purpose of FEDOT is to identify a suitable composite model for a given dataset.
The model is obtained via optimization process (we also call it 'composing').\
Firstly, you need to prepare datasets for fit and validate and specify a task
that you going to solve:

.. code-block:: python

  task = Task(TaskTypesEnum.classification)
  dataset_to_compose = InputData.from_csv(train_file_path, task=task)
  dataset_to_validate = InputData.from_csv(test_file_path, task=task)

Then, chose a set of models that can be included in the composite model, and the optimized metric function:

.. code-block:: python

  available_model_types, _ = ModelTypesRepository().suitable_model(task_type=task.task_type)
  metric_function = MetricsRepository().metric_by_id(ClassificationMetricsEnum.ROCAUC

Next, you need to specify requirements for composer.
In this case, GPComposer is chosen that is based on evolutionary algorithm.

.. code-block:: python

  composer_requirements = GPComposerRequirements(
    primary=available_model_types,
    secondary=available_model_types, max_arity=3,
    max_depth=3, pop_size=20, num_of_generations=20,
    crossover_prob=0.8, mutation_prob=0.8, max_lead_time=20)
  composer = GPComposer()

Now you can run the optimization and obtain a composite model:

.. code-block:: python

  chain_evo_composed = composer.compose_chain(data=dataset_to_compose,
                                              initial_chain=None,
                                              composer_requirements=composer_requirements,
                                              metrics=metric_function,
                                              is_visualise=False)

Finally, you can test the resulted model on the validation dataset:

.. code-block:: python

  roc_on_valid_evo_composed = calculate_validation_metric(chain_evo_composed,
                                                          dataset_to_validate)
  print(f'Composed ROC AUC is {round(roc_on_valid_evo_composed, 3)}')

Basic Concepts
===============

The main process of FEDOT work is *composing* leading to the production of the composite models.

**Composer** is a block that takes meta-requirements and an evolutionary algorithm as an optimization one
and get different chains of models to find the most appropriate solution for the case.

The result of composing and basic object user works with is the Chain:

**Chain** is the tree-based structure of any composite model. It keeps the information of nodes relations
and everything referred to chain properties and restructure.

In fact, any chain has two kinds of nodes:
 - **Primary nodes**: edge (leaf) nodes of the tree where initial case data is located.
 - **Secondary nodes**: all other nodes which transform data during the composing and fitting, including root node with result data.

Meanwhile every node holds the *Model* which could be ML or any other kind of model.
