The dried cranberry and cherry flavors are rich and tart, backed by quite astringent tannins.",,87,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dussek Family Cellars
US,"Chris Gorman is the winemaker for this pure, old vine Cabernet Sauvignon. Despite the high alcohol and the use of 100% new French oak, most of the old vine nuances are still there—a wild mix of heather and herb with berry and grain scents that weave together in the mouth. Brambly and tart, with strawberry and cherry fruit, it's a compelling wine that keeps you on your toes.",Collaboration Series V Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,93,80.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Force Majeure
US,"Somewhat light in color, this is an aromatically appealing wine that shows a complex assortment of coffee, vanilla, pencil lead, cherry, blueberry and high-toned herbal notes. It's exquisitely polished in its styling, with plush tannins and a long, lingering finish. A pretty expression of the variety that shows a great degree of elegance and deftness, it drinks well out of the gate but continues to improve with additional time to breathe.",Double Canyon Vineyard,93,48.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Double Canyon
US,"From a seven-acre section of the vineyard, this offers plenty of saddle leather and cedar amidst spicy cardamom layers, a soft, juicy core and tingling acidity. The structure and weight suggest the ability to cellar comfortably through 2020.",Red Rock Terrace,93,200.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek
US,"Principally Klipsun vineyard fruit, this is a mass of black cherry and cassis, wreathed in smoke from aging in 80% new French barrels. Great balance and length carry it through into drying tannins. A perfect steakhouse Cabernet.",Kingpin,93,62.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sparkman
France,"Smoky and toasty, this is a structured wine. It has layers of black currant fruits, fresh acidity as well as firm tannins that overlay the juicy fruitiness. It needs to age. Drink from 2016.",,88,16.0,Bordeaux,Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Chantemerle

US,"Toasty scents and flavors of the barrels (40% new) cloak tart raspberry fruit. It's clean and efficient, though for the moment at least, the barrel flavors outrun the rather light fruit. That can change over time, so give this one until 2015 or so in bottle.",Estate,88,36.0,Oregon,McMinnville,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Coeur de Terre
US,"Bright orange juice, dill herbs and a slight whiff of vanilla bean lead the aromas on this un-oaked Chard. On the palate, flavors of apple cider come with a wash of fresh lime juice on the back end.",Limited Selection,88,24.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Daniel Gehrs
US,"Sourced from the estate vineyard—the same vineyard that fuels the Private Stash reserve—this shows a dusty, somewhat charred character, presumably from the barrel aging. Along with the slightly burnt toast character comes plenty of black cherry fruit, and acids that leave a slightly chalky impression in the finish.",Wits' End,88,60.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Roco
US,"The other realm of the coin from Brown Ranch, Toyon is leaner and lighter, its color even subdued, a study in wild strawberry and layered floral highlights, oak and cardamom spice. It bristles with acidity, pleasant to sip on its own or with bacon-wrapped figs.",Toyon Farm,88,54.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Saintsbury
US,"Smells of rust, iron, tomato and untracked peppercorns rise to the nose. On the palate, the wine is quite light and racy, with a little boysenberry and more sanguine flavors. Hold onto this one until 2016 for maximum enjoyment, as more flavors will emerge.",Guidotti Vineyard,88,61.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"Oso Libre ventures into the nonvintage category with this blend of 10 wines from the past five years, delivering a nose with blackberry and a pinch of pepper. The meaty wine really gets your attention once sipped, with boysenberry, cracked peppercorn, some iron and a lingering licorice flavors.",Primoroso,88,39.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blend,Oso Libre
US,"There's a lot happening on nose of this wine from Sta. Rita Hills pioneer Richard Sanford's recently rejuvenated Alma Rosa label. Aromas suggest light butterscotch, baked pear, fresh pluot and jasmine. Once sipped, the flavors don't live up to the aromatic promise, but apple, pear and a sharper tangerine rind round out the flavors.",,88,18.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Alma Rosa
Argentina,"Immediately this smells raisiny, but with time secondary scents of cinnamon and Middle Eastern spices come into play. The body is soft and extracted, with modest acidity.

Don't drink before 2017.",Clos du Cailleret Premier Cru,92,94.0,Burgundy,Chassagne-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Domaine Vincent Girardin
US,"The southern Napa Coombsville area is near San Pablo Bay, making it a cool area.

Drink now.",Haynes Vineyard,92,58.0,California,Coombsville,Napa,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"This is such a good Pinot, and so reflective of the Sonoma Coast, that its price makes it a steal. With low alcohol and brisk acidity, it's translucent in color, with a gleaming ruby hue. The mouthfeel is silky and delicate, yet the raspberry, cola and buttered cinnamon toast flavors are intense. Drink now–2020.",,92,32.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Les Voleurs
US,"A great follow-up to the winery's 2011, made this time from an esteemed vineyard in one of the coldest parts of the valley.

There's no reason not to drink it now.",Solomon Hills Vineyard,92,43.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Ryan Cochrane
France,"The minty aromas indicate new wood aging as well as a ripe, polished texture. They make for a wine that has presence and structure as well as rich fruitiness, blackberry flavors and a dry, solid core. It's a sophisticated wine that can age. Drink from 2017.",Réserve,92,30.0,Bordeaux,Graves,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut Selve
US,"Made from 100% Cabernet, this wine shows the intensity of fruit that Mount Veeder is capable of expressing. It also has excellent acidity. But the tannins are astringently strong, giving a numbing sting to the palate. This certainly needs time. Give it until 2022 and beyond.",Lampyridae Vineyards,92,100.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Communication Block
France,"There is a great balance here between the creamy fruit and the wood flavors. Apricots, ripe apples and melon are spiced with the right amount of toastiness. The wine has a rich, warm feel. It is still young, so wait until 2015 to drink.",Les Charmes Dessus,91,60.0,Burgundy,Santenay,,Chardonnay,Domaine de Bellene
France,"Hugely tannic at this stage, this dense and complex wine has great structure partnered with dark black fruit and licorice. There is forward bitterness, suggesting this wine needs aging.

US,"Sourced from a 15-acre vineyard on Parrett Mountain, this displays single vineyard specificity.

Clean blueberry fruit leads into a tasty, balanced finish.",Clay Court,91,60.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Elk Cove
France,"Still firm and closed, this is a structured wine, solidly tannic with just hints of fruit. It has a dry feel to it, firm, the acidity and red fruits coming through the leathery, dark texture.

US,"There is a darker fruit spectrum evident in the reserve, with notes of coffee, smoke, black fruits, a touch of charred wood all worked through, and without damping the core fruit flavors.

US,"Intensely aromatic, yet big and even chunky in the mouth, this young wine remains compressed and hard-edged. Give it ample aeration, and cranberry, blackberry and black cherry fruits come alive.

Spain,"Ripe pure black-fruit aromas are touched up by notes of malty chocolate and mocha.

US,"Warm vanilla notes are laid across ripe nectarine, apple skin and a twist of lemon rind on this single-vineyard study by the Los Gatos-based winery.

Lenoble 
Israel,"Restrained aromas of black plum barely set the stage for flavors of dark plum, cherry-vanilla, mint eucalyptus and ground black pepper.

US,"Blended from several stellar vineyard sites, including La Cruz and Devoto, this wine presents a brightness of acidity and crisp, red fruit.

US,"Some ageable Cabs are lovely to drink on release. Not this one. It's tough in tannins, with a gum-stinging astringency. Below all that are ripe, concentrated blackberry jam and cassis flavors. Blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's already throwing some sediment, a good sign, which means you won't have to wait 20 years for it to come around.

US,"A small planting of an unusual “Upright” clone yields this fragrant, smoky, lightly earthy Pinot Noir. Chock full of briary red fruits, it's a tart, lip-smacking wine, drinking well in its youth, but also positioned (via bracing acidity) for further years of bottle age.

US,"This is a tannic, acidic, hard-to-appreciate wine due to the cold conditions of the 2011 vintage.

Medium in weight, it eases into a mellow finish.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,88,46.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bruliam

Spain,"Blackberry, cherry and earthy aromas are backed by a secondary wave of oaky char. This is 80% Garnacha and 20% Carignan with raw clamp to the palate created by grabby tannins and tomatoey acidity. Briny raspberry and plum flavors finish with rubbery tannins and related grab.

France,"With vines in the northeast of the Gers region, this winery produces impressively ripe red wines.

US,"This is a rich, broad-shouldered Pinot Noir, woodsy and oaky with a firm and fierce grip on the palate. It leans more toward earth and smoke than exuberant fruit.
