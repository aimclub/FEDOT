The Guns of August,Barbara Tuchman,"Paperback,– 5 Jun 2014",3.5,8.0,"Barbara Tuchman's The Guns of August is a spellbinding history of the fateful first month when Britain went to war.
War pressed against every frontier. Suddenly dismayed, governments struggled and twisted to fend it off. It was no use . . .
Barbara Tuchman's universally acclaimed, Pulitzer prize-winning account of how the first thirty days of battle determined the course of the First World War is to this day revered as the classic account of the conflict's opening. From the precipitous plunge into war and the brutal and bloody battles of August 1914, Tuchman shows how events were propelled by a horrific logic which swept all sides up in its unstoppable momentum.

The philosopher Plato wrote these words more than two thousand years ago, following a perilous voyage to Italy -- an experience about which he never spoke again, but from which he emerged the greatest thinker in all of human history.
Today, twelve golden tablets sit in museums around the world, each created by unknown hands and buried in ancient times, and each providing the dead with the route to the afterlife. Archaeologist Lily Barnes, working on a dig in southern Italy, has just found another.
But the thirteenth tablet is different. This tablet names the location to the mouth of hell itself.
And then Lily vanishes.
Has she walked out on her job, her marriage, and her life -- or has something more sinister happened? Her husband, Jonah, is desperate to find her. But no one can help him: not the police; not the secretive foundation that sponsored her dig; not even a circle of university friends who seem to know more than they're saying. All Jonah has is belief, and a determination to do whatever it takes to get Lily back.
But like Plato before him, Jonah will discover the journey ahead is mysterious and dark and fraught with danger.

The Other Side of Me,Sidney Sheldon,"Paperback,– 7 Nov 2005",4.1,18.0,"The Sheldon family were immigrants to the USA; a fairly dysfunctional family, constantly on the move, either fleeing debt crises or seeking possible employment all over the country. In the 1930's America's economy was in crisis, businesses were folding everywhere and more than thirteen million people lost their jobs. Sidney attended eleven different schools, worked by night at manual and temporary jobs. Sidney had always wanted to write and even when working as a busboy in a Chicago hotel managed to write for the local newspaper. But it was song-writing and radio that gave him his first break.
In New York he worked as a barker for Radio City Music Hall, carrying on writing, seeking music publishers and choosing whether to have a hot dog for five cents and walk thirty-five blocks home or not to eat and take the subway home. Moving on to the Californian dream, he found a boarding house full of people with dreams and haunted the studio gates for a job as a writer, a reader, anything. His skill and persistence won and Sidney Sheldon's career had begun. But shortly afterwards, Pearl Harbor led to his joining the Army Air Corps and learning to fly.
Amazingly, between training and flying, the indefatigable Sheldon started writing librettos for New York musical theatre, starting with an updated version of The Merry Widow (Balanchine was the choreographer), meeting stars like Kirk Douglas at the beginning of their careers, finding as many flops as successes. Returning to Hollywood, he found his screenplay career took off. He worked with actors like Cary Grant, Shirley Temple; with legendary producers like David Selznick and Dory Schar; and musical stars like Irving Berlin, Judy Garland and Gene Kelly. This is the amazing story of how Sidney Sheldon turned to writing television series and finally the books for which we all know him.
The Other Side of Me is a wonderful story of a remarkable life, and of a man who has tried his hand at, and succeeded in, every form of writing.",Biographies & Autobiographies (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.359835482339888

So begins this epic, mesmerizing first novel set in the underworld of contemporary Bombay. Shantaram is narrated by Lin, an escaped convict with a false passport who flees maximum security prison in Australia for the teeming streets of a city where he can disappear.
Accompanied by his guide and faithful friend, Prabaker, the two enter Bombay's hidden society of beggars and gangsters, prostitutes and holy men, soldiers and actors, and Indians and exiles from other countries, who seek in this remarkable place what they cannot find elsewhere.
As a hunted man without a home, family, or identity, Lin searches for love and meaning while running a clinic in one of the city's poorest slums, and serving his apprenticeship in the dark arts of the Bombay mafia. The search leads him to war, prison torture, murder, and a series of enigmatic and bloody betrayals. The keys to unlock the mysteries and intrigues that bind Lin are held by two people.

When a politician like Sheila Dikshit, with a career spanning over three decades, chooses to let the reader get a glimpse of her life's journey, the opportunity brings along an element of surprise. In a fascinating account of her life, contoured along the life of the nation and her political party at critical junctures, she creates a richly patterned universe with deft touches, seamlessly moving between the home and the world, the past and the present.
Be it encounters with politics, which she terms 'life at its barest' or the ups and downs of a household, what shines through is the portrait of a modern woman determined to face any eventuality with fortitude, and a deep sense of duty.
Interestingly, she never wanted to be in politics, but destiny willed otherwise - a destiny shaped by her liberal upbringing in a Punjabi household. Brought up to be independent, she chose her life partner from another part of India. And that started it all.
As the wife of an IAS officer and daughter-in-law of well-known freedom fighter and politician, Uma Shankar Dikshit, with his long association with the Nehru-Gandhi family, she saw governance from both ends. When she began assisting her father-in-law from 1969, her up-close view of politics eventually became a springboard for her own entry into the arena in December 1984, inaugurating a 30-year-long career in politics. The narrative foregrounds a question that the author considers crucial for democracy - how does one deal with the constant tussle between the dictates of governance and the here-and-now preoccupations of party politics?",Contemporary Fiction (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.4899584794248346

"The Solution Revolution: How Business, Government and Social Enterprises are Teaming Up to Solve Society's Toughest Problems",Eggers,"Hardcover,– 9 Sep 2013",5.0,2.0,"Government alone can't solve society's biggest problems: World hunger, Climate change, Crumbling infrastructure. It's clear that in today's era of fiscal constraints and political gridlock, we can no longer turn to government alone to tackle these and other towering social problems. What's required is a new, more collaborative and productive economic system. The Solution Revolution brings hope revealing just such a burgeoning new economy where players from across the spectrum of business, government, philanthropy and social enterprise converge to solve big problems and create public value. By erasing public-private sector boundaries, the solution economy is unlocking trillions of dollars in social benefit and commercial value. Where tough societal problems persist, new problem solvers are crowdfunding, ridesharing, app-developing, or impact-investing to design innovative new solutions for seemingly intractable problems. Providing low-cost health care, fighting poverty, creating renewable energy and preventing obesity are just a few of the tough challenges that also represent tremendous opportunities for those at the vanguard of this movement. They create markets for social good and trade solutions instead of dollars to fill the gap between what government can provide and what citizens need. So what drives the solution economy? Who are these new players and how are their roles changing? How can we grow the movement? And how can we participate? Deloitte's William D. Eggers and Paul Macmillan answer these questions and more and they introduce us to the people and organizations driving the revolution from edgy social enterprises growing at a clip of 15 percent a year, to megafoundations, to Fortune 500 companies delivering social good on the path to profit. Recyclebank, RelayRides and LivingGoods are just a few of the innovative organizations you'll read about in this book. Government cannot handle alone the huge challenges facing our global society and it shouldn't. We need a different economic paradigm that can flexibly draw on resources, combine efforts and create value, while improving the lives of citizens.

It cites evidence that Jesus lived in India for a large part of his life after the crucifixion and died there at old age.

This book states that he survived the crucifixion, and after that returned to India where he finally died in Jammu & Kashmir.
Jesus Lived In India was published in 2001 by Penguin India, and is available in paperback format.

The Expert at the Card Table: Classic Treatise on Card Manipulation (Dover Magic Books),S. W. Erdnase,"Paperback,– 19 Jul 1995",4.2,5.0,"""The Expert at the Card Table is the most famous, the most carefully studied book ever published on the art of manipulating cards at gaming tables."" —from the Foreword by Martin Gardner.
For almost a century, this book has been considered indispensable to attaining the highest level of card mastery. In it, S. W. Erdnase, a supreme master of card manipulation, teaches card enthusiasts how to perform the dazzling tricks and sleights — many of them his own creations — that made him famous.
The first section of the book deals with card table artifice, or, to put it more bluntly, cheating at cards. Step by step, Mr. Erdnase demonstrates his own systems of false shuffling, false riffling and cutting, dealing from the bottom, and such slick moves as palming cards, ""skinning the hand"" — even three-card monte.
The second section covers legerdemain: the art of forcing a card, one- and two-hand transformations, the devious ""slide"" and more. Card handlers will love Erdnase's selection of dazzling card tricks, including The Acrobatic Jacks, The Exclusive Coterie, The Divining Rod, The Invisible Flights, A Mind Reading Trick, and many others.
In an informative Foreword to this edition, Martin Gardner relates the unhappy details of the author's personal life, and recounts the history of this famous book, whose methods, Mr. Gardner asserts, ""are as useful today by magicians and card hustlers as they were in 1902. This book is still the bible of card 'mechanics,' and as much a delight to read as it was in the early years of this century.""",Games & Quizzes (Books),Humour,2.741151598851785

My Experiments With Truth,Mohandas K. Gandhi,"Paperback,– 2 Feb 2013",4.1,162.0,"There is a reason as to why there can never be another Mahatma Gandhi. 'The Story of My Experiments with Truth’ is the compelling autobiography of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who in his quest for freedom of his country, inspired millions with the strength of his willpower and personal actions. His immovable belief in truth and non-violence even in the most difficult situations made him a true hero. India has seen many heroes rise and sacrifice themselves for the greater good, but rarely has there been a man as great and as noble as Mahatma Gandhi who captured the imagination of the whole world. He is a 'Maha-atma' in the truest sense of the word. The book traces the unordinary journey of an ordinary man who became one of the main pillars of the Indian independence movement. There has never been a biography so honest in its attempt. One of the major assets of the book is that it has been writing in an easy to understand language.
The book is an overall account of his long journey wherein he had to deal with travesties and social issues using his ideology of truth, will power, self-discipline, honesty, his understanding of Satyagraha and his lifestyle of vegetarianism. The most amiable aspect of this book is that not once does Gandhi try to over emphasize his achievements and victories. His humble nature shines throughout and his belief in God is unshakable. Trust, according to him, is the reward for all of his great achievements. This autobiography is truly the mark of a great mind. Anyone who bases their ideologies on Gandhi can cause a significant change in his/her life for the better. Gandhi depicts honest records of his own internal psychological and personal struggles.
About the author

A Manifesto for Change,A.P.J. Abdul Kalam,"Paperback,– 6 Jul 2014",4.8,38.0,"In 1998, a book was published that was surprisingly ahead of its times. It was called India 2020 and proposed that India could soon be one of the top five economies of the world. The nation had set off a series of nuclear tests and was facing worldwide sanctions. A new government had taken charge, and the economy was facing a tough time. It was not the best of times to predict that India had it in her to get on the fast track to development. The vision presented in the book would go on to inspire, directly or indirectly, many sectors of the economy to work for and achieve high growth. The book has since sold hundreds of thousands of copies. In A Manifesto for Change, its author A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, writing with co-author V. Ponraj, offers a sequel. As focused then as now on his dream of a developed India by 2020, the eleventh President of India examines what we need to get right to accomplish that essential goal: harnessing the stupendous energy of our youth to contribute to growth, a united Parliament that makes full use of its time for constructive debate and rises above petty party politics to achieve the larger national vision, and a plan of action that looks at development from the grassroots to giant strides in infrastructure and bridging the urban-rural disparity.

America is an enormous frosted cupcake in the middle of millions of starving people.

It was a watershed moment in the history of technology, machine intelligence had arrived at the point where it could best human intellect. It wasn't a coincidence that Kasparov became the symbol of man's fight against the machines. Chess has long been the fulcrum in development of machine intelligence, the hoax automaton 'The Turk' in the 18th century and Alan Turing's first chess program in 1952 were two early examples of the quest for machines to think like humans a talent we measured by their ability to beat their creators at chess. Like all passionate competitors, Kasparov has taken his defeat and learned from it. He has devoted much energy to devising ways in which humans can partner with machines in order to produce results better than either can achieve alone. During the twenty years since playing Deep Blue, he's played both with and against machines, learning a great deal about our vital relationship with our most remarkable creations. Ultimately, he's become convinced that by embracing the competition between human and machine intelligence, we can spend less time worrying about being replaced and more thinking of new challenges to conquer. In this breakthrough book, Kasparov tells his side of the story of Deep Blue for the first time what it was like to strategize against an implacable, untiring opponent the mistakes he made and the reasons the odds were against him. But more than that, he tells his story of AI more generally and how he's evolved to embrace it, taking part in an urgent debate with philosophers worried about human values, programmers creating self-learning neural networks and engineers of cutting edge robotics.",Computer Science Books,"Computing, Internet & Digital Media",2.568201724066995

For ten years, 509 has been a political prisoner in a German concentration camp, persevering in the most hellish conditions. Deathly weak, he still has his wits about him and he senses that the end of the war is near. If he and the other living corpses in his barracks can hold on for liberation—or force their own—then their suffering will not have been in vain.
 
Now the SS who run the camp are ratcheting up the terror. But their expectations are jaded and their defenses are down. It is possible that the courageous yet terribly weak prisoners have just enough left in them to resist. And if they die fighting, they will die on their own terms, cheating the Nazis out of their devil’s contract.

In 1939, Homer Kelley played golf for the first time and scored 116. Frustrated, he did not play again for six months; when he did he carded a 77. Determined to understand why he was able to shave nearly 40 strokes off his score, Kelley spent three decades of trial and error to unlock the answer and to recapture that one wonderful day when golf was easy and enjoyable. In 1969, Kelley self- published his findings in The Golfing Machine: The Computer Age Approach to Golfing Perfection.

The bestselling instruction books of the day required golfers to conform their swings to the author's ideals, but Homer Kelley configured swings to fit every golfer. He found an enthusiastic disciple in a Seattle teaching pro named Ben Doyle, who in turn found an eager student in 13-year-old prodigy Bobby Clampett. Clampett's initial success in amateur golf shined a bright spotlight on Homer Kelley and The Golfing Machine, but when the young star suffered a painfully public collapse and faltered as a pro, critics were quick to blast Kelley and his complex and controversial ideas. With exclusive access to Homer Kelley's archives, author Scott Gummer paints a fascinating picture of the man behind the machine, the ultimate outsider who changed the game once and for all of us.",Baseball (Books),Sports,3.86350130064145
Wise Guy,Guy Kawasaki,"Hardcover,– 30 Apr 2019",5.0,8.0,"Guy Kawasaki has been a fixture in the tech world since he was part of Apple's original Macintosh team in the 1980s. He's widely respected as a source of wisdom about entrepreneurship, venture capital, marketing and business evangelism, which he's shared in bestselling books such as the art of the start and enchantment. But before all that, he was just a middle-class kid in Hawaii, a grandson of Japanese immigrants, who loved football and got a C+ in 9th grade English. Wise guy, his most personal book, is about his surprising journey. It's not a traditional memoir but a series of vignettes. He toyed with calling it miso soup for the soul, because these stories (like those in the chicken soup series) reflect a wide range of experiences that have enlightened and inspired him. For instance, you'll follow guy as he -Gets his first real job in the jewels business-which turned out to be surprisingly useful training for the tech world. -Disparages one of Apple's potential partners in front of that company's CEO, at the sneaky instigation of Steve Jobs. -Blows up his Apple career with a single sentence, after jobs withholds a pre-release copy of the Think different ad campaign: ""that's okay, Steve, I don't trust you either."" -revaluates his self-importance after being mistaken for Jackie Chan by four young women. -Takes up Surfing at age 62--which teaches him that you can discover a new passion at any age, but younger is easier!

Quantum Healing (Revised and Updated): Exploring the Frontiers of Mind/Body Medicine,Deepak Chopra M.D.,"Paperback,– 17 Nov 2015",2.6,3.0,"THE LANDMARK BESTSELLER—NOW COMPLETELY REVISED AND UPDATED
 
More than twenty-five years ago, Quantum Healing helped transform Deepak Chopra into a cultural phenomenon. Now Dr. Chopra, hailed by Time as “the poet-prophet of alternative medicine,” returns to this groundbreaking exploration of consciousness and the power of mindfulness, adding the latest scientific research as well as expanded thoughts on the connection between body and mind.
 
Inspired by the unexplained recovery of patients in his own practice who had been given just a few months to live, Dr. Chopra began his search for answers. After returning to his native India to explore humanity’s most ancient healing tradition, Ayurveda, he combined those insights with Western medicine, neuroscience, and physics. What he discovered—a “network of intelligence” in the human body with the potential to defeat cancer, heart disease, even aging itself—forms the basis of Quantum Healing. In this new edition, Dr. Chopra once again offers a fascinating intellectual journey and a deeply moving chronicle of hope and healing.
 
Praise for Quantum Healing
 
“Quantum Healing didn’t set out to cure cancer or Alzheimer’s or any other intractable disease. It set out to see the human body, and human existence in general, through wiser eyes. As a scientist I’m passionate about genes and the brain; as a person I’m totally fascinated by the origins of consciousness. Quantum Healing galvanized my intuition that these areas do not have to be separated.”—Dr. Rudolph Tanzi, from the new foreword
 
“Deepak Chopra illuminates our true innate capacity for healing, growth, and evolution. With the wisdom of an experienced doctor, girded by science, he guides us to reclaim our natural power towards thriving. Chopra’s work is paradigm-changing for medicine and helpful beyond measure for every human being seeking to evolve, flourish, and know our true nature.”—Lisa Miller, Ph.D., author of The Spiritual Child and director of clinical psychology, Teachers College, Columbia University",Mental & Spiritual Healing,Action & Adventure,2.725454239433493

The Death of Ivan Ilyich,Leo Tolstoy,"Hardcover,– Import, 25 Apr 2011",4.0,8.0,"Leo Tolstoy's novella The Death of Ivan Ilyich begins shortly after Ivan Ilyich's death. A small group of legal professionals, court members, and a private prosecutor have gathered in a private room within the Law Courts, and while looking through a newspaper one of them reads the following; ""Praskovya Fedorovna Golovina, with profound sorrow, informs relatives and friends of the demise of her beloved husband Ivan Ilyich Golovin, Member of the Court of Justice, which occurred on February the 4th of this year 1882. The funeral will take place on Friday at one o'clock in the afternoon."" Immediately members of the group begin to think how Ilyich's passing will affect their positions and status; They thank God it didn't happen to them and ponder on the implications of how they might benefit from their colleagues demise, each one of them oblivious of the fact that death will come to them all. A-- The story takes us back and we see Ivan Ilyich in the prime of his life. He has studied law and is now a judge. He performs his work with a cold discipline and he is a social climber who has become devoid of emotion. He lacks empathy and any concern for his fellow man, seeking only to reach the top where he can look down upon his peers. One day Ivan has a fall whilst decorating his new house. He sustains an injury and although he doesn't know it, the injury will cause him to become ill and he will die as a result. During his illness he becomes bad tempered and bitter and refuses to believe he is coming to the end of his life. He gets little sympathy from his family and his only solace are his conversations with Gerasim, a peasant who stays by his bed and gives him honesty and kindness. Reflecting on his current situation and his past life Ivan's worldview begins to change. He realizes the higher he climbed in his noble profession the more unhappy he became, and looking back he realizes how meaningless his life had been. Slowly Ivan comes to term with his immanent death and finally he sees the light. He begins to feel sorry for those about him busying themselves living a life of habit unable to see how artificial their existence is and that they are not living a good life at all. Finally after his illumination he dies in a moment of exquisite happiness. The Death of Ivan Ilyich is Tolstoy's attack on the smug satisfaction of a middle and upper class population, who in his mind live artificial meaningless lives, lives of separateness unaware of their creator and what lies before them after death. Tolstoy's critic Vladimir Nabokov summed it up when he wrote; ""The Tolstoyan formula is: Ivan lived a bad life and since the bad life is nothing but the death of the soul, then Ivan lived a living death; and since beyond death is God's living light, then Ivan died into a new life - Life with a capital L.""","Crime, Thriller & Mystery (Books)","Crime, Thriller & Mystery",2.724275869600789

Ayako,Osamu Tezuka,"Paperback,– 12 Feb 2013",4.3,4.0,"Long considered as one of Osamu Tezuka’s most political narratives, Ayako is also considered to be one of his most challenging as it defies the conventions of his manga by utilizing a completely original cast and relying solely on historical drama to drive the plot.  Ayako, pulls no punches, and does not allow for gimmicks as science-fiction or fantasy may.  Instead Tezuka weaves together a tale which its core simply focuses on a single family, a family that could be considered a metaphor for a rapidly developing superpower.

Overflowing with imagery of the cold war seen through Japan’s eyes, Ayako is firmly set in realism taking inspiration from a number of historical events that occurred over the American occupation and the cultural-revolution which soon followed. Believed to be Tezuka’s answer to the gekiga (dramatic comics) movement of the 60’s, Ayako should be considered one of the better early examples of a seinen (young adult) narrative to be published.

Initially set in the aftermath of World War II, Ayako focuses its attention on the Tenge clan, a once powerful family of landowners living in a rural community in northern Japan.  From the moment readers are introduced to the extended family, it is apparent that the war and American occupation have begun to erode the fabric that binds them all together.  The increasing influence of political, economic and social change begins to tear into the many Tenge siblings, while a strange marriage agreement creates resentment between the eldest son and his sire.  And when the family seems to have completely fallen apart, they decide to turn their collective rage on what they believe to be the source of their troubles—the newest member of the Tenge family, the youngest sister Ayako.",Mangas,"Crime, Thriller & Mystery",3.146128035678238

Although Professor Stephen West a by was born with the necessary coordination and manual dexterity, it was a head trauma sustained during University that gifted him the qualities of an exceptional heart surgeon: qualities that are frequently associated with psychopathy.

A truly brilliant thriller by Tom Clancy, The Bear and the Dragon is a Jack Ryan novel.
Newly elected in his own right, Jack Ryan has found that being President has gotten no easier: domestic pitfalls await him at every turn; the Asian economy is going down the tubes; and now, in Moscow, someone may have tried to take out the chairman of the SVR - the former KGB - with a rocket-propelled grenade. Things are unstable enough in Russia without high-level assassination, but even more disturbing may be the identities of the potential assassins. Were they political enemies, the Russian Mafia, disaffected former KGB? Or, Ryan wonders, is something far more dangerous at work here?
Ryan is right to wonder. For even while Russian investigators pursue the case, and some of his most trusted eyes and ears, including antiterrorism specialist John Clark, head to Moscow, forces in China are moving forward with a plan of truly audacious proportions. Tired of what they view as the presumption of the West, eager to fulfill their destiny, they are taking matters into their own hands. If they succeed, the world as we know it will never look the same. If they fail. . . the consequences may be unspeakable.
The Bear and the Dragon is Tom Clancy at his best - and there is none better. This is the third Jack Ryan thriller, following Without Remorse and Rainbow Six.

China: 1200 A.D.
The Song Empire has been invaded by its warlike Jurchen neighbours from the north. Half its territory and its historic capital lie in enemy hands; the peasants toil under the burden of the annual tribute demanded by the victors. Meanwhile, on the Mongolian steppe, a disparate nation of great warriors is about to be united by a warlord whose name will endure for eternity: Genghis Khan.
Guo Jing, son of a murdered Song patriot, grew up with Genghis Khan's army. He is humble, loyal, perhaps not altogether wise, and is fated from birth to one day confront an opponent who is the opposite of him in every way: privileged, cunning and flawlessly trained in the martial arts.
Guided by his faithful shifus, The Seven Heroes of the South, Guo Jing must return to China - to the Garden of the Drunken Immortals in Jiaxing - to fulfil his destiny. But in a divided land riven by war and betrayal, his courage and his loyalties will be tested at every turn.

The Odessa File,Frederick Forsyth,"Paperback,– 7 Apr 2011",4.4,27.0,"First published in 1972, The Odessa File is a thriller that was authored by Frederick Forsyth. It is an account of the adventures that a young German reporter goes through when he tries to find out the location of an ex-SS concentration camp commander. The book alleges that ODESSA, which is the short form for the Organisation of Former Members of the SS, was an international Nazi outfit that existed even before the Nazis were defeated during the second world war.
The story in the novel begins with the suicide of Salomon Tauber, an elderly Jew and a Holocaust survivor. Peter Miller, a German freelance crime-reporter assigned to report the case, pursues not just the suicide but also the story behind it. Miller happens to lay his hands on a diary that the old man religiously wrote: a diary that mentions the name of the Butcher of Riga, Eduard Roschmann, who was the ruthless concentration camp commander.
Miller’s pursuit leads him to make revelation after revelation about the Nazis, which ultimately leads him to discover ODESSA, a mafia-like organisation created by the Nazis. But Miller’s task is not restricted to just uncovering the organisation. The Mossad agents, who seek to kill the German war crime perpetrators, approach him. Now Miller must actually infiltrate ODESSA. What follows is a thrilling story of some more stunning revelations that Miller makes as he searches for the concentration camp commander, who is a mass murderer of the Jews.
The Odessa File was published by McGraw Hill Professional in 2008 and is available in paperback format.
Key Features:
The Odessa File was adapted into a film by the same name that released in 1974 and starred Jon Voight and Maximilian Schell.
The film is loosely based on the novel but it also brought-to-light the fate of the real-life Eduard Roschmann.",Action & Adventure (Books),Action & Adventure,2.4756711883244296

Neural Networks and Deep Learning: A Textbook,Charu C. Aggarwal,"Hardcover,– Import, 13 Sep 2018",5.0,,"This book covers both classical and modern models in deep learning. The primary focus is on the theory and algorithms of deep learning. The theory and algorithms of neural networks are particularly important for understanding important concepts, so that one can understand the important design concepts of neural architectures in different applications. Why do neural networks work? When do they work better than off-the-shelf machine-learning models? When is depth useful? Why is training neural networks so hard? What are the pitfalls? The book  is also rich in discussing different applications in order to give the practitioner a flavor of how neural architectures are designed for different types of problems. Applications associated with many different areas like recommender systems, machine translation, image captioning, image classification, reinforcement-learning based gaming, and text analytics are covered. The chapters of this book span three categories:
The basics of neural networks:  Many traditional machine learning models can be understood as special cases of neural networks.  An emphasis is placed in the first two chapters on understanding the relationship between traditional machine learning and neural networks. Support vector machines, linear/logistic regression, singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, and recommender systems are shown to be special cases of neural networks. These methods are studied together with recent feature engineering methods like word2vec.
Fundamentals of neural networks: A detailed discussion of training and regularization is provided in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapters 5 and 6 present radial-basis function (RBF) networks and restricted Boltzmann machines.
Advanced topics in neural networks: Chapters 7 and 8 discuss recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Several advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning, neural Turing machines, Kohonen self-organizing maps, and generative adversarial networks are introduced in Chapters 9 and 10.
The book is written for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners.   Numerous exercises are available along with a solution manual to aid in classroom teaching. Where possible, an application-centric view is highlighted in order to provide an understanding of the practical uses of each class of techniques.",Computer Hardware & Handheld Devices (Books),"Computing, Internet & Digital Media",3.632486649094526

Introducing Fractals: A Graphic Guide,Nigel Lesmoir-Gordon,"Paperback,– 3 Sep 2009",3.9,4.0,"Fractals are the geometry of the natural world. They're about the broken, wrinkled, wiggly world- the uneven shapes of nature, unlike the idealised forms of Euclidean geometry. We see fractals everywhere; indeed, we are fractals ourselves. Fractal geometry is an extension of classical geometry which can make precise models of physical structures, from ferns to galaxies. It can describe the shape of a cloud as precisely as an architect can describe a house. Introducing Fractals traces the historical development of this mathematical discipline, explores its descriptive powers in the natural world, and then looks at the applications and the implications of the discoveries it has made. As John Archibald Wheeler, protege of Niels Bohr, friend of Albert Einstein and mentor of Richard Feynman has said, 'No one will be considered scientifically literate tomorrow, who is not familiar with fractals.'",Geometry,Comics & Mangas,2.380211241711606

Past Tense: A Jack Reacher Novel,Lee Child,"Mass Market Paperback,– Import, 30 Apr 2019",3.9,46.0,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Family secrets come back to haunt Jack Reacher in this electrifying thriller from “a superb craftsman of suspense” (Entertainment Weekly).

Jack Reacher hits the pavement and sticks out his thumb. He plans to follow the sun on an epic trip across America, from Maine to California. He doesn’t get far. On a country road deep in the New England woods, he sees a sign to a place he has never been: the town where his father was born. He thinks, What’s one extra day? He takes the detour.

At the same moment, in the same isolated area, a car breaks down. Two young Canadians had been on their way to New York City to sell a treasure. Now they’re stranded at a lonely motel in the middle of nowhere. The owners seem almost too friendly. It’s a strange place, but it’s all there is.

The next morning, in the city clerk’s office, Reacher asks about the old family home. He’s told no one named Reacher ever lived in town. He’s always known his father left and never returned, but now Reacher wonders, Was he ever there in the first place?

As Reacher explores his father’s life, and as the Canadians face lethal dangers, strands of different stories begin to merge. Then Reacher makes a shocking discovery: The present can be tough, but the past can be tense . . . and deadly.

Don’t miss a sneak peek of Lee Child’s novel Blue Moon in the back of the book.

Ultramarathon Man: Confessions of an All-Night Runner,Dean Karnazes,"Paperback,– 2 Mar 2006",4.7,4.0,"In one of his most ambitious physical efforts to date, Dean Karnazes attempted to run 50 marathons, in 50 states, in 50 days to raise awareness of youth obesity and urge Americans of all fitness levels to ""take that next step.""
""UltraMarathon Man: 50 Marathons - 50 States - 50 Days"", a Journeyfilm documentary, follows Dean’s incredible step-by-step journey across the country.
Ultrarunning legend Dean Karnazes has run 262 miles-the equivalent of ten marathons-without rest.

With an insight, candor, and humor rarely seen in sports memoirs (and written without the aid of a ghostwriter or cowriter), Ultramarathon Man has inspired tens of thousands of people-nonrunners and runners alike-to push themselves beyond their comfort zones and be reminded of ""what it feels like to be truly alive,"" says Sam Fussell, author of Muscle.

Ultramarathon Man answers the questions Karnazes is continually asked:

- Why do you do it?
- How do you do it?
- Are you insane?

And in the new paperback edition, Karnazes answers the two questions he was most asked on his book tour:

- How do you train to stay in such good shape?",Hockey,Sports,2.6580113966571126
The Man Who Saved India,Hindol Sengupta,"Hardcover,– 31 Aug 2018",4.7,36.0,"There is perhaps no political figure in modern history who did more to secure and protect the Indian nation than Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. But, ironically, seventy years after Patel brought together piece by piece the map of India by fusing the princely states with British India to create a new democratic, independent nation, little is understood or appreciated about Patel's enormous contribution to the making of India. Caricatured in political debate, all the nuances of Patel's difficult life and the daring choices he made are often lost, or worse, used as mere polemic. If Mahatma Gandhi was the spiritual core of India's freedom struggle and Jawaharlal Nehru its romantic idealism, it was Sardar Patel who brought in the vital pragmatism which held together the national movement and the first ideas of independent India. A naturally stoic man, Patel, unlike Gandhi or Nehru, wrote no personal history. He famously argued that its was better to create history than write it. This is why even his deepest misgivings and quarrels have been easily buried. But every warning that Patel left for India - from the dangers of allowing groups to create private militias to his thoughtful criticism on India's approach to Kashmir, Pakistan and China - are all dangerously relevant today. It is impossible to read about Patel, who died in 1950, and not feel that had he lived on, India might have been a different country. It is also impossible to ignore Patel and understand not only what the idea of India is but also what it could have been, and might be in the future. The Man Who Saved India is a sweeping, magisterial retelling of Sardar Patel's story. With fiercely detailed and pugnacious anecdotes, multiple award-winning, best-selling writer Hindol Sengupta brings alive Patel's determined life of struggle and his furious commitment to keep India safe. This book brings alive all the arguments, quarrels and clashes between some of the most determined people in Indian history and their battle to carve out an independent nation. Through ravages of a failing body broken by decades of abuse in and outside prison, Patel stands out in this book as the man who, even on his death bed, worked to save India. Hindol Sengupta's The Man Who Saved India is destined to define Patel's legacy for future generations.
Praise for the book:
Sardar Patel was the silent one of the trinity along with Gandhi and Nehru who dedicated his life. In the struggle for an independent India. His lasting legacy is a United India rather than the land which throughout history has-been split in rival warring kingdoms. Hindol Sengupta has given us the story of Sardar's life for the new generations of India so that they could understand and admire a unique personality. Read this book and discover India's history in the first half the last century. And reclaim your legacy.
- Lord Meghnad Desai, bestselling author and economist
""It is dangerous to put dreamers in power. Sardar Patel's pragmatism was the perfect antidote to Nehru's idealism in the early years of Independence. If only Patel had lived longer, India would have been spared the excesses of the License Raj and the Kashmir problem. This is one of the messages of this lively, highly readable book.""
- Gurcharan Das, bestselling author
The Man Who Saved India is the most authoritative and accessible biography of Sardhar Vallabhbhai Patel, lovingly referred to as the 'Iron Man of India'. In this book, written in his impeccable narrative style, Hindol Sengupta rescues the memory of the beloved leader of India from the vaults of obscurity. This book brings out the true story of independence as well as stability of India following it, which was achieved through sweat and blood of its leaders like Patel.
The Man who Saved India reverses one of the historical ironies of modern India through bringing into light many of the unknown facts of the life of Patel, based on the author's field visits, interviews, and extensive research, which is an onerous task in itself considering the fact that Patel neither maintained records of his work nor preserved his documents of communications.
Hindol begins the narration of larger than life tale of Patel describing his visit to the birth home of Patel in Nadiad, now in dilapidated condition, an image not unlike the less than optimal public memory of Patel in modern India.
Hindol discusses the numerous sacrifices Patel has made in public life bowing to the political ambitions of his peers, while never wavering from his duty to India. The Man who Saved India clearly charts the leadership skills and statesmanship of Patel during the numerous non-cooperation and civil disobedience movements such as Bardoli and Kheda Satyagrahas, and the timely military action in independent India. It was due to the sheer strength of resolve on the part of Patel, which has helped forge the Bharat that was to capture the imagination of the masses of independent India.
The hitherto unknown details of Patel's personal life and his complex relations with his peers and other contemporary national leaders including Gandhi, Nehru, and Bose, help understand the grace with which he gave up political positions more than once. In addition, the author also clearly describes the personal sacrifices Patel has made at the altar of mother India, not only of his personal life, but also of the life of his children, even to the chagrin of his family and friends.
The amazing result of author's copious research is the emergence of an exceptionally clear picture of Patel's life and leadership in the three decades leading up to the independence of India in addition to establishing Patel's key role in the formative years of India following independence, until his death. The Man who Saved India is a timely and much needed historical account of modern India.
The Man who Saved India is a must read for every Indian as well as every person interested in learning the true history of India.
- Lavanya Vemsani, Professor, Shawnee State University, Vice President, Ohio Academy of History, President & Cofounder, American Academy of Indic Studies
Every nation has its own narrative that is built over time, even centuries. For India and as Indians we claim ancient ancestry and are therefore, civilisational. Yet, we are a new democratic republic trying to find our place in the new tumultuous 21st century.
There comes a time when we cannot look forward without revisiting our past to see if the narrative of the past was complete, accurate and fair. For decades, the narrative has been that there were essentially two leaders in India - Mahatma Gandhi and his protégé Jawahar Lal Nehru, who together had led the country to independence. Their contribution to the cause of independence was monumental and this became the widely accepted truth. Yet there was another truth, long ignored in our national narrative.
Hindol Sengupta's book, The Man Who Saved India, provides the other truth. In a meticulously and extensively researched book, the young author brings to the reader the significant role that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played not only in our struggle for independence but in the consolidation of the new country. Valabhbhai Patel was truly a part of the Trinity, along with Mahatma Gandhi and Jawahar Lal, that led India to freedom. He was the man who ensured that this newfound independence did not collapse in a heap of dust. It was the Sardar who dealt with the reluctant Maharajas, Nawabs and the obdurate Nizam of Hyderabad, when they dreamt of returning to their feudal opulence outside modern India. Patel liquidated the princely states without liquidating the princes. It was his commitment, diplomatic and political skills along with the force of his personality that made unified India a reality.
The book begins with a description of what was once the ancestral home of this great man of India. This decrepit and rather lonely state of the house and its utter neglect is a clear indication that the prevalent narrative preferred to ignore Valabhbhai Patel's contribution. Gandhi knew the value of God and religion in an India that was subjugated. Nehru knew that if India had to talk about its future then there had to be a grand past of aloofness and elitism. It was Patel who was the hard realist who knew that democracy was not about daily plebiscites but hard decisions cloaked in egalitarianism. Nehru looked at the heavens for inspiration Patel looked at the ground beneath his feet for solutions. While Nehru wrote elegant prose and Gandhi spoke to the masses, it was left to Patel to worry over mundane matters about funds and their distribution. Patel was a man of few words and there is every reason to give him credit today for many of his arguments and ideas ranging from tackling Kashmir, the future of Pakistan and how socialism without industrialization could be dangerous for the country. His warnings about Kashmir, Tibet and China went unheeded.
The book is thus not only one of the finest biographies in recent times but is also a much-needed redefining of the roles played by Sardar Patel during India's freedom movement and as the great unifier. The author argues that Patel was not only a pillar of strength behind some of Gandhi's earlier successes to holding the country together.
The author quotes Patel's speech on 5 July 1947 where he warned, ""Our mutual conflicts and internecine quarrels and jealousies have in the past been the cause of our downfall and our falling victim to foreign domination a number of times. We cannot afford to fall into these errors or traps again."" Sardar Patel was relevant then as he is today. So is Hindol Sengupta's book.
- Vikram Sood, bestselling author and the former head of India's foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing
The Man Who Saved India is an excellent deep dive into the life and struggles of one of the tallest leaders in Indian history. Hindol Sengupta written a fascinating book full of insights on things that are rarely discussed - for instance, Patel's economic ideas or his key role as the man who raised critical funds for the Congress Party. This captivating book breaks many myths and throws new light on one of the most important figures in Indian history.
- Vijay Govindarajan, NYT and Wall Street Journal bestselling author, Coxe Distinguished Professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College
A very engaging biography of Sardar Patel, the man and his times, by one of India's best young writers
- Sanjeev Sanyal, bestselling author and Principal Economic Advisor, Ministry of Finance, Government of India
The genre of popular history and biography has been experiencing a golden age and Hindol Sengupta's fluent biography of Sardar Vallabhai Patel joins a list of distinguished titles alongside Michael Axworthy's Sword of Persia, Nadir Shah and Roger Crowley's Constantinople, The Last Great Siege, 1453. Very welcome indeed that an eminently accessible account of the life and achievements of one of India's true great sons is now available to a new generation of readers.
- Gautam Sen, lecturer (retd.), London School of Economics and co-author of Analysing the Global Political Economy, Princeton University Press, 2009.
Rich with detail and illuminating insight, Hindol Sengupta's The Man Who Saved India brings alive Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's indomitable spirit and tenacity in the face of constant challenges that would crush a weaker man. Few people immediately think of Patel when they think of men responsible for the shape and form of modern India. This is a great injustice, for, as Hindol explains with a wealth of anecdote and context, it was Patel who defined the very contours of the India we know today. This book is a must read.
- - Saradindu Mukherji, Member, Indian Council of Historical Research
Hindol writes popular, unpopular history. Another brilliant book, this time putting the untold story of one of India's greatest political leaders in front of today's readers in a way which makes it accessible and unputdownable. His work of putting together Sardar Patel's life story is strikingly accurate yet stunningly engrossing.
- Vikramjit Bannerjee, Senior Advocate, Supreme Court of India, and Advocate General of Nagaland
'This is one of those rare, great books which every Indian should read. After all, it is also about Vallabhbhai Patel, the man who created the modern state of India out of myriad fragments. Drawing upon a well-researched base of facts and writings, Sengupta emerges as a masterful storyteller who has weaved together a very coherent and absorbing story. The complex relationships among the leaders of the Indian freedom struggle are captured in all their subtle shades and colourful complexity. The end result is, for the reader, a more holistic understanding of Indian history, a much-needed filling up of certain gaps in our knowledge of the past, and a refreshingly enriched perspective on the architects of modern India'

The Nine Waves: The Extraordinary Story of Indian Cricket,Mihir Bose,"Hardcover,– 15 May 2019",4.0,2.0,"The nine waves is a tour de force. The most entertaining and comprehensive book on cricket in this country to be published yet, it tells the story of the nine great waves that have rolled through the history of Indian cricket, from India’s international debut in 1932 to the incredible achievements of viral Kohli’s team today. Each wave or era was chock-full of mesmerizing stars, thrilling moments, great victories, heart-breaking losses and significant turning points—this book tells the story of each of them in great detail. The first wave of Indian cricket rolled in against the background of momentous changes in the country and the world: Gandhi’s Civil disobedience campaign, world War II and India becoming independent. Through each of the successive waves, India strengthened its position in the Cricketing firmament. Towards the end of the twentieth century, it became the most powerful nation in world cricket—the prowess of the National team today matches the economic strength of the Cricketing establishment. As a five-year-old, the author saw Vijay Hazare, India’s first test-winning Captain, play. Since then he has been witness to some of the most dramatic moments of Indian cricket: India’s first win in England in 1971, Kapil Dev lifting the world Cup in 1983 at Lord’s, Tendulkar’s first test century at old trafford in 1990, Sunil Gavaskar scoring his 30th test century, the 2011 World Cup in India where M. S. Dhoni emulated Kapil Dev, Virat Kohli in 2018 in England proving he is the best batsman in the world today and much more. He brings to the book his first-hand experience of some of the most seminal moments in Indian cricket, his Encyclopaedic knowledge of the game and his unrivalled ability as a chronicler of the sport to create a magisterial history of Indian cricket. Once dismissed by the English as the dull dogs of cricket, India is now eagerly courted by all Cricketing nations. On the field its cricketers are displaying skills which make India a world-beater. Over a billion Indians, the greatest fan base in the world, treat their cricketers as demigods. The nine waves is a fitting testimonial to the game’s only superpower.""",Biographies & Autobiographies (Books),Sports,2.9030899869919438

The world’s foremost designer in Formula One, Adrian Newey OBE is arguably one of Britain’s greatest engineers and this is his fascinating, powerful memoir.

How to Build a Car explores the story of Adrian’s unrivalled 35-year career in Formula One through the prism of the cars he has designed, the drivers he has worked alongside and the races in which he’s been involved.

A true engineering genius, even in adolescence Adrian’s thoughts naturally emerged in shape and form – he began sketching his own car designs at the age of 12 and took a welding course in his school summer holidays. From his early career in Indy Car racing and on to his unparalleled success in Formula One, we learn in comprehensive, engaging and highly entertaining detail how a car actually works. Adrian has designed for the likes of Mario Andretti, Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill, David Coulthard, Mika Hakkinen, Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel, always with a shark-like purity of purpose: to make the
car go faster. And while his career has been marked by unbelievable triumphs, there have also been deep tragedies; most notably Ayrton Senna’s death during his time at Williams in 1994.

Beautifully illustrated with never-before-seen drawings, How to Build a Car encapsulates, through Adrian’s remarkable life story, precisely what makes Formula One so thrilling – its potential for the total synchronicity of man and machine, the perfect combination of style, efficiency and speed.",Design,"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.7937903846908188

Along with his son and heir, Narayan Sai, he has now become an example of everything that is wrong with self-styled godmen and the cults they spawn. The two stand accused of sexual assaults on vulnerable devotees, land grabbing, money laundering, intimidation, exploitative black magic rituals and the horrific murder of witnesses who testified against them. Politically, Asaram Bapu held significant boroughs of influence across north India and the Hindi belt, and there are photos of him with almost every known political leader throughout the 1990s and 2000s, till his arrest in a sexual assault case in 2013.
Asaram originated the business model of branding goods and selling them to followers, using faith as a marketing tool-which other godmen emulated to great success. His commercial empire, now being investigated by economic offences agencies, was built on unaccounted donations, loans given on hefty rates of interest, investments in dubious companies, money laundering and dodgy real estate deals.

Scott McCloud tore down the wall between high and low culture in 1993 with Understanding Comics, a massive comic book about comics, linking the medium to such diverse fields as media theory, movie criticism, and web design. In Reinventing Comics, McCloud took this to the next level, charting twelve different revolutions in how comics are generated, read, and perceived today. Now, in Making Comics, McCloud focuses his analysis on the art form itself, exploring the creation of comics, from the broadest principles to the sharpest details (like how to accentuate a character's facial muscles in order to form the emotion of disgust rather than the emotion of surprise.) And he does all of it in his inimitable voice and through his cartoon stand–in narrator, mixing dry humor and legitimate instruction. McCloud shows his reader how to master the human condition through word and image in a brilliantly minimalistic way. Both comic book devotees and the uninitiated will marvel at this journey into a once–underappreciated art form.",Design,"Language, Linguistics & Writing",2.9283958522567137

Strangers No More: New Narratives from India’s Northeast,Sanjoy Hazarika,"Hardcover,– 20 Jan 2018",3.5,9.0,"Over twenty years ago, Sanjoy Hazarika’s first book on the Northeast, Strangers of the Mist, was published to immediate acclaim. Hailed as an exciting, path-breaking narrative on the region, it has been cited extensively in studies of Northeast India, used as a resource for scholars and journalists and adopted as course material in colleges.
Two decades later, in his new book, armed with more stories, interviews and research and after extensive travels through the region, Hazarika explains how and where things stand in the Northeast today. He examines old and new struggles, contemporary trends and the sweeping changes that have taken place and asks whether the region and its people are still ‘different’ to the rest of India, to each other and whether they are destined to remain so. While it may not be possible to overcome lingering hatred, divisions and differences by brute force, economic might or efforts at cultural or political assimilation, there are other ways forward. These include the process of engagement of accepting, if not embracing, the ‘Idea of India’ and working on forging connections between disparate cultures to overcome the mutual suspicions that have existed for decades. Hazarika tells little-known stories, drawn from personal experience and knowledge, of the way in which insurgents operate, of the reality of border towns in the region, the pain of victims and the courage of fighters on either side of the ideological and physical conflict, in the jungles and in lands awash with rain and swamped by mist. He travels across borders and mountains, listening to tales of the people of the region and those who live in neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar. He challenges the stereotype of the ‘North easterner’, critiques the categorization of the ‘Bangladeshi’, deals with issues of ‘race and discrimination’ and suggests best practices that could be used to deal with intractable issues and combatants. Critically, he tries to portray the way in which new generations are grappling with old and current issues with an eye to the future. Extensively researched and brilliantly narrated, strangers no more is arguably the most comprehensive book yet available about India’s Northeast.",Government (Books),Politics,2.6541765418779604

In Brain Droppings, the author states the seven things that he is tired of tolerating. He says that people who smoke pipes can’t be very intelligent as they have fire sticking out of their mouth. He also complains about car alarms. If these alarms didn't exist, then carjackings would actually decrease. Carlin also has a strong dislike for bearded men and those who walk around listening to their walkmans. Like most people, he also hates having to be put on hold when calling customer care. Furthermore, readers will giggle at how the comedian complains about books that describe clouds. Who cares what a cloud looks like?
Finally, Carlin states that he finds it very difficult to find clothes that don't have sayings, slogans and brand names printed on them. In Brain Droppings, readers will also get to know about the kinds of people that the author thinks need to be phased out.

‘A sapphic graphic treat’ The Times

A moving and darkly humorous family tale, pitch-perfectly illustrated with Alison Bechdel's gothic drawings. If you liked Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis you’ll love this.

Meet Alison's father, a historic preservation expert and obsessive restorer of the family's Victorian home, a third-generation funeral home director, a high-school English teacher, an icily distant parent, and a closeted homosexual who, as it turns out, is involved with his male students and the family babysitter. When Alison comes out as homosexual herself in late adolescence, the denouement is swift, graphic, and redemptive.

Interweaving between childhood memories, college life and present day, and through narrative that is equally heartbreaking and fiercely funny, Alison looks back on her complex relationship with her father and finds they had more in common than she ever knew.

Mrs Funnybones,Twinkle Khanna,"Paperback,– 18 Aug 2015",4.1,1558.0,"Mrs Funnybones unravelled
Almost everyone has a similar family story in India and this is what Mrs Funnybones or rather Twinkle Khanna pokes fun at. The husband who’s the “man of the house”, the crazy mothers in law, friends and of course the constant jibes at her weight make it an intriguing read. Everything comes together to leave the reader cackling away in laughter.
Dwell deeper because this book will certainly make you think
The tag line of the book, 'She’s just like and a lot like me” coupled with the celebrity author might make one wonder, how can one compare a normal Indian household life with the glamorous life of someone like Twinkle Khanna. But that is the beauty of this book. It is not entirely an autobiography of the author, nor is it the typical tell all that celebrities so often write. This is a book of a woman who is a mother of two, an ordinary version of the star and someone who finds humour in the everyday situations that women in India face every day. That is what makes the book relatable even though it has been written by someone who’s the daughter of celebrities and married to one. Through her own anecdotes and by drawing parallels between a star’s life and a normal life, she has managed to write a book which is funny yet at the same time it forces you to think and comment on the situation. Mrs Funnybones is a comical take on the life of modern Indian women.

SIX FOUR.
THE NIGHTMARE NO PARENT COULD ENDURE.
THE CASE NO DETECTIVE COULD SOLVE.
THE TWIST NO READER COULD PREDICT.
For five days in January 1989, the parents of a seven-year-old Tokyo schoolgirl sat and listened to the demands of their daughter's kidnapper. They would never learn his identity. They would never see their daughter again.
For the fourteen years that followed, the Japanese public listened to the police's apologies. They would never forget the botched investigation that became known as 'Six Four'. They would never forgive the authorities their failure.
For one week in late 2002, the press officer attached to the police department in question confronted an anomaly in the case. He could never imagine what he would uncover. He would never have looked if he'd known what he would find.

It includes a range of states of mind, conjoined with action, from the courage to face dangerous or difficult challenges to an almost spiritual state for which words like 'inspired' or 'spiritual' come to mind. Achieving it requires us to be able to hold different tendencies, different tensions in mind, to tolerate ambivalence and ambiguity. For example, there is the need for hard work, but hard work can be misguided or limiting; there is a need to let go of conscious control and to allow things to come up involuntarily. It involves giving house-room to different aspects of the mind, finding a balance between doing and watching oneself, as indeed between work and play. He suggests that though one can't guarantee form, or creativity, in any area, we do have some understanding of how we might make it more likely. We have to give space to ourselves and our projects. We have to learn to tolerate emotions and work on them so that they don't inhibit our freedom to think and act. There is no easy recipe; but this book will help people in all walks of life to reflect on the kinds of conditions that can block us or free us.",Cricket (Books),Sports,2.7641761323903307

‘Dear Diary: This morning I met the man I am going to marry.’ It was a simple enough entry in a young woman’s diary which gave not the slightest portent of the elaborate chain of events that was about to occur.
The Best Laid Plans tells the explosive story of the beautiful and ambitious Leslie Stewart, who learns that for some men power is the greatest aphrodisiac; and of Oliver Russell, the handsome governor of a small southern state, who finds out why hell has no fury like a woman scorned.
With the unexpected twists and turns that are the hallmarks of his mega best-selling novels, Sidney Sheldon spins a tale of two equally determined people headed on a collision course. Oliver has a strategy to win the White House; Leslie has a scheme to make him wish he’d never been born.

Icon,Frederick Forsyth,"Paperback,– 3 Jul 1997",4.2,19.0,"It is 1999 and Russia is on the edge of total implosion. Social and moral order has collapsed and what small semblance of control there is, is being imposed by mafia-like criminal gangs. While public opinion in the West is largely indifferent, the political analysts are less sanguine - Russian meltdown will make the disintegration of the Balkans look like the collapse of a cup-cake. Out of the chaos, however, a single charismatic voice is starting to be heard - that of Igor Komarov, a visionary patriot who claims he can restore Russia's greatness and bring prosperity to the masses. He even woos Western political leaders with a rather more realistic analysis of the way forward for Russia. Komarov is set to win the next election when a document is smuggled into the British Embassy in Moscow. It's called The Black Manifesto and it appears to show Komarov's secret agenda - his political blueprint is really Mein Kampf, the rebirth of Russia will be as a New Third Reich with Komarov as Fuhrer. But can the document be authenticated? And what can the Western Alliance's most secret Trilateral Commission do about it if it is? They need to find another voice the masses will listen to and obey rather than Komarov - an icon they can cleave to and trust. Once, not that long ago, he was called the Tsar.

And so develops a thrilling and increasingly frightening adventure - Jason Monk, ex-CIA, who used to run agents into the Soviet Union, is recruited and slips back into Russia, into the desperate Moscow world of poverty, luxury, gangsters and prostitutes and underneath it all, the titanic power struggle to ensure the outcome of the forthcoming elections.","Crime, Thriller & Mystery (Books)","Crime, Thriller & Mystery",2.3138672203691533

Slash: The Autobiography,Slash,"Paperback,– 5 May 2008",4.4,10.0,"It seems excessive…but that doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.
The mass of black curls. The top hat. The cigarette dangling from pouty lips. These are the trademarks of one of the world’s greatest and most revered guitarists, a celebrity musician known by one name: Slash.
Saul “Slash” Hudson was born in Hampstead to a Jewish father and a black American mother who created David Bowie’s look in The Man Who Fell to Earth. He was raised in Stoke until he was 11, when he and his mother moved to LA. Frequent visitors to the house were David Bowie, Joni Mitchell, Ronnie Wood and Iggy Pop.
At this time Slash got into BMX bikes and would eventually turn professional, winning major awards and money, but at 15 his grandmother gave him his first guitar. Sessions with numerous local LA rock bands followed until a fateful meeting with singer W Axl Rose…and the rest was rock history. Guns N’ Roses spent two years builiding their reputation before Appetite for Destruction was unleashed on an unsuspecting world.
Chart success and global domination followed but with it came the inevitable fall – addicted to heroin, booze and cigarettes the band imploded in a rift between Axl and Slash that is as deep today as ever. But with a new wife, kids and new band Velvet Revolver, Slash is back on track. As raucous and edgy as his music, Slash sets the record straight and tells the real story as only Slash can.",Music Books,"Arts, Film & Photography",2.697717431656452

The world’s foremost designer in Formula One, Adrian Newey OBE is arguably one of Britain’s greatest engineers and this is his fascinating, powerful memoir.

How to Build a Car explores the story of Adrian’s unrivalled 35-year career in Formula One through the prism of the cars he has designed, the drivers he has worked alongside and the races in which he’s been involved.

A true engineering genius, even in adolescence Adrian’s thoughts naturally emerged in shape and form – he began sketching his own car designs at the age of 12 and took a welding course in his school summer holidays. From his early career in Indy Car racing and on to his unparalleled success in Formula One, we learn in comprehensive, engaging and highly entertaining detail how a car actually works. Adrian has designed for the likes of Mario Andretti, Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill, David Coulthard, Mika Hakkinen, Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel, always with a shark-like purity of purpose: to make the
car go faster. And while his career has been marked by unbelievable triumphs, there have also been deep tragedies; most notably Ayrton Senna’s death during his time at Williams in 1994.

Beautifully illustrated with never-before-seen drawings, How to Build a Car encapsulates, through Adrian’s remarkable life story, precisely what makes Formula One so thrilling – its potential for the total synchronicity of man and machine, the perfect combination of style, efficiency and speed.",Design,"Arts, Film & Photography",2.7937903846908188

Ashok wandered amidst the corpses, helplessly, looking like a dead man walking among the dead. The wailing of people who had lost their loved ones on the battlefield cut into his soul and it was then that he heard a cry for help.
As realization of the devastation of war seeped in, Ashok decided to dedicate his life towards the betterment of society and try his best to prevent any destruction of life.

Park Bench,Christophe Chabouté,"Paperback,– Import, 19 Sep 2017",5.0,,"With his masterful illustration style, bestselling French creator-storyteller Chabouté (Alone, Moby-Dick) explores community through a common, often ignored object: the park bench.

From its creation, to its witness to the fresh ardor of lovers, the drudgery of businessmen, the various hopes of the many who enter its orbit, the park bench weathers all seasons. Strangers meet at it for the first time. Paramours carve their initials into it. Old friends sit and chat upon it for hours. Others ignore the bench, or (attempt to) sleep on it at night, or simply anchor themselves on it and absorb the ebb and flow of the area and its people.

Christophe Chabouté’s mastery of the visual medium turns this simple object into a thought-provoking and gorgeously wrought meditation on time, desire, and the life of communities all across the planet. This could be a bench in my hometown or yours—the people in this little drama are very much those we already recognize.","Crime, Thriller & Mystery (Books)",Comics & Mangas,3.180125875164054

It was the biggest leak in history. WikiLeaks infuriated the world's greatest superpower, embarrassed the British royal family and helped cause a revolution in North Africa.

In London, Assange went to ground in the back bedroom of the Ecuadorian embassy. Meanwhile, in a courtroom near Washington, the fate of the US army whistleblower Bradley Manning hung in the balance. And in Hawaii, a young man named Edward Snowden, working as a contractor for the National Security Agency, was about to take WikiLeaks into even darker territory.

Humble Inquiry; The Gentle Art of Asking Instead of Telling (The Humble Leadership Series),Edgar H. Schein,"Paperback,– 2 Sep 2013",4.8,11.0,"We live, says Ed Schein, in a culture of Tell. Rather than trying to genuinely relate to other people we tell them what we think they need to know or should do based on assumptions we’ve made about them. But telling makes people feel inferior―it shuts them down. This is particularly true of interactions between superiors and subordinates, and that’s where it’s particularly problematic. In today’s complex, interconnected, rapidly changing world hierarchy means nothing―anybody anywhere could have that vital fact or insight that could mean the difference between success or disaster. A free flow of information is crucial.
Humble Inquiry builds the kinds of positive, trusting, balanced relationships that encourage honest and open interactions in both our professional and personal lives. Schein defines Humble Inquiry as “the fine art of drawing someone out, of asking questions to which you do not know the answer, of building a relationship based on curiosity and interest in the other person.” In this seminal work he explores the concept of humility, looks at how Humble Inquiry differs from other kinds of inquiry, offers examples of Humble Inquiry in action in many different settings, and shows how to overcome the cultural, organizational and psychological barriers that keep us from practicing it This is a major new contribution to how we see human dynamics and relationships, presented in a compact, personal, eminently practical way.",Media Studies,"Language, Linguistics & Writing",2.9552065375419416

Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return (Pantheon Graphic Novels),Marjane Satrapi,"Paperback,– 2 Aug 2005",4.0,5.0,"In Persepolis, heralded by the Los Angeles Times as “one of the freshest and most original memoirs of our day,” Marjane Satrapi dazzled us with her heartrending memoir-in-comic-strips about growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. Here is the continuation of her fascinating story. In 1984, Marjane flees fundamentalism and the war with Iraq to begin a new life in Vienna. Once there, she faces the trials of adolescence far from her friends and family, and while she soon carves out a place for herself among a group of fellow outsiders, she continues to struggle for a sense of belonging.

Finding that she misses her home more than she can stand, Marjane returns to Iran after graduation. Her difficult homecoming forces her to confront the changes both she and her country have undergone in her absence and her shame at what she perceives as her failure in Austria. Marjane allows her past to weigh heavily on her until she finds some like-minded friends, falls in love, and begins studying art at a university. However, the repression and state-sanctioned chauvinism eventually lead her to question whether she can have a future in Iran.

As funny and poignant as its predecessor, Persepolis 2 is another clear-eyed and searing condemnation of the human cost of fundamentalism. In its depiction of the struggles of growing up—here compounded by Marjane’s status as an outsider both abroad and at home—it is raw, honest, and incredibly illuminating.","Arts History, Theory & Criticism (Books)",Comics & Mangas,2.714329759745233

Understanding The Linux Network Internals,Benvenuti,"Paperback,– 2006",5.0,,"Linux is popular partly because of its efficient and feature-rich network stack. If you've been wondering how Linux carries out the complicated tasks assigned to it by the IP protocols or if you just want to learn about modern networking through real-life examples Understanding Linux Network Internals is your guide.

Like the popular O'Reilly book Understanding the Linux Kernel, this book clearly explains the concepts behind system functioning and teaches you how to follow the actual C code that implements it. Although some background in the TCP/IP protocols is helpful, readers can learn a great deal from this text about the protocols themselves and their uses. And having grasped the concepts enumerated in this book, readers with a knowledge of C can use the book's code walk-throughs to figure out exactly what this sophisticated part of the Linux kernel is doing.

Part of the difficulty in understanding networks and implementing them is that the tasks are broken up and performed at many different times by different pieces of code. One of the strengths of this book is to integrate the pieces and show you the relationships between far-flung functions and data structures. Understanding Linux Network Internals is both a big-picture discussion and a no-nonsense guide to the details of Linux networking.

Topics in this book include:

Key problems with networking.
Network interface card (NIC) device drivers.
System initialization.
Layer 2 (link-layer) tasks and implementation.
Layer 3 (IPv4) tasks and implementation.

If you're already a bit-convert, you'll still learn a lot’ Niall Ferguson, author of The Ascent of Money

1988 saw the birth of the internet. 2008 gave us bitcoin. Today, cybercurrencies are changing the world we live in. What would a world without banks, credit cards or national currencies look like for all of us?
For centuries, the system that governs how money works has stayed the same. Now there’s an alternative, and it puts us on the cusp of a revolution that could reshape our world. At the heart of this lie, cryptocurrencies, a technology with the transformative potential of the printing press or the internet. They bypass the elites and cut out the gatekeepers. Unlike traditional money, they don’t have a nationality, they’re digital and democratic. They are also lawless.

From Silicon Valley to the streets of Beijing, this is a book about a revolution in the making, a story of human invention, and a guide to the future.

Exactly: How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World,Simon Winchester,"Paperback,– 10 Jun 2018",4.8,9.0,"Bestselling author Simon Winchester writes a magnificent history of the pioneering engineers who developed precision machinery to allow us to see as far as the moon and as close as the Higgs boson.

Precision is the key to everything. It is an integral, unchallenged and essential component of our modern social, mercantile, scientific, mechanical and intellectual landscapes. The items we value in our daily lives – a camera, phone, computer, bicycle, car, a dishwasher perhaps – all sport components that fit together with precision and operate with near perfection. We also assume that the more precise a device the better it is. And yet whilst we live lives peppered and larded with precision, we are not, when we come to think about it, entirely sure what precision is, or what it means. How and when did it begin to build the
modern world?

Simon Winchester seeks to answer these questions through stories of precision’s pioneers. Exactly takes us back to the origins of the Industrial Age, to Britain where he introduces the scientific minds that helped usher in modern production: John ‘Iron-Mad’ Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden and Joseph Whitworth. Thomas Jefferson exported their discoveries to the United States as manufacturing developed in the early twentieth century, with Britain’s Henry Royce developing the Rolls
Royce and Henry Ford mass producing cars, Hattori’s Seiko and Leica lenses, to today’s cutting-edge developments from Europe, Asia and North America.

As he introduces the minds and methods that have changed the modern world, Winchester explores fundamental questions. Why is precision important? What are the different tools we use to measure it? Who has invented and perfected it? Has the pursuit of the ultra-precise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old traditions of craftsmanship, art and high culture? Are we missing something that reflects the world as it is, rather than the world as we think we would wish it to be? And can the precise and the natural co-exist in society?",Astronomy (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.606381365110605

Dale Carnegie (1888–1955) was an American writer and lecturer and the developer of famous courses in self-improvement, salesmanship, corporate training, public speaking and interpersonal skills.
He was born in an impoverished family in Maryville, Missouri. Carnegie harboured a strong love and passion for public speaking from a very early age and was very proactive in debate in high school. During the early 1930’s, he was renowned and very famous for his books and a radio program.

Carnegie loved teaching others to climb the pillars of success. His valuable and tested advice was used in many domains and has been the inspiration of many famous people’s success.

Compelling, profound, complex, it is the story of a patricide and of the four sons who each had a motive for murder: Dmitry, the sensualist, Ivan, the intellectual; Alyosha, the mystic; and twisted, cunning Smerdyakov, the bastard child. Frequently lurid, nightmarish, always brilliant, the novel plunges the reader into a sordid love triangle, a pathological obsession, and a gripping courtroom drama. But throughout the whole, Dostoevsky searhes for the truth--about man, about life, about the existence of God.

Black Hole,Charles Burns,"Hardcover,– 6 Oct 2005",4.5,5.0,"And you thought your adolescence was scary.

Suburban Seattle, the mid-1970s. We learn from the outset that a strange plague has descended upon the area's teenagers, transmitted by sexual contact. The disease is manifested any number of ways - from the hideously grotesque to the subtle (and concealable) - but once you've got it, that's it. There's no turning back.

As we inhabit the heads of several key characters - some kids who have it, some who don't, some who are about to get it - what unfolds isn't the expected battle to fight the plague, or bring heightened awareness of it, or even to treat it. What we become witness to instead is a fascinating and eerie portrait of the nature of high-school alienation itself - the savagery, the cruelty, the relentless anxiety and ennui, the longing for escape.

And then the murders start.

As hypnotically beautiful as it is horrifying (and, believe it or not, autobiographical), Black Hole transcends its genre by deftly exploring a specific American cultural moment in flux and the kids who are caught in it - back when it wasn't exactly cool to be a hippie any more, but Bowie was still just a little too weird.

The Music of the Primes,Marcus du Sautoy,"Paperback,– 6 Sep 2004",3.7,4.0,"The paperback of the critically-acclaimed popular science book by a writer who is fast becoming a celebrity mathematician.
Prime numbers are the very atoms of arithmetic. They also embody one of the most tantalising enigmas in the pursuit of human knowledge. How can one predict when the next prime number will occur? Is there a formula which could generate primes? These apparently simple questions have confounded mathematicians ever since the Ancient Greeks.
In 1859, the brilliant German mathematician Bernard Riemann put forward an idea which finally seemed to reveal a magical harmony at work in the numerical landscape. The promise that these eternal, unchanging numbers would finally reveal their secret thrilled mathematicians around the world. Yet Riemann, a hypochondriac and a troubled perfectionist, never publicly provided a proof for his hypothesis and his housekeeper burnt all his personal papers on his death.
Whoever cracks Riemann's hypothesis will go down in history, for it has implications far beyond mathematics. In business, it is the lynchpin for security and e-commerce. In science, it has critical ramifications in Quantum Mechanics, Chaos Theory, and the future of computing. Pioneers in each of these fields are racing to crack the code and a prize of $1 million has been offered to the winner. As yet, it remains unsolved.
In this breathtaking book, mathematician Marcus du Sautoy tells the story of the eccentric and brilliant men who have struggled to solve one of the biggest mysteries in science. It is a story of strange journeys, last-minute escapes from death and the unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Above all, it is a moving and awe-inspiring evocation of the mathematician's world and the beauties and mysteries it contains.",Mathematics (Books),Humour,2.6989700043360187

John Pilger is one of the world’s renowned investigative journalists and documentary filmmakers. In this classic book, with an updated introduction, he reveals the secrets and illusions of modern imperialism. Beginning with Indonesia, he shows how General Suharto’s bloody seizure of power in the 1960s was part of a western design to impose a “global economy” on Asia. A million Indonesians died as the price for being the World Bank’s “model pupil.” In a shocking chapter on Iraq, he delineates the true nature of the West’s war against the people of that country. And he dissects, piece by piece, the propaganda of the ‘war on terror’ to expose its Orwellian truth. Finally, he looks behind the picture-postcard image of his homeland, Australia, to illuminate an enduring legacy of imperialism: the subjugation of the First Australians.

David Yarrow travels from pole to pole and continent to continent to visit frozen Arctic tundras, vast African deserts, primordial rain forests, and remote villages, inviting us to truly connect with subjects we mistakenly think we have seen before.

Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron: mathematician, gambler, and proto-programmer, whose writings contained the first ever appearance of general computing theory, a hundred years before an actual computer was built. And Charles Babbage, eccentric inventor of the Difference Engine, an enormous clockwork calculating machine that would have been the first computer, if he had ever finished it.
But what if things had been different? The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage presents a delightful alternate reality in which Lovelace and Babbage do build the Difference Engine and use it to create runaway economic models, battle the scourge of spelling errors, explore the wider realms of mathematics and, of course, fight crime - for the sake of both London and science.

Former ambassador Alan Nazareth, a globally recognised scholar on Gandhian thought, elucidates in this book on how Gandhi was much more than that; how the essence of his ideology was a rare and distinctive combination of truth and non-violence—a pro-active, passionate and path-breaking approach, rather than a passive absence of violence. His biggest contribution, in fact, was to channelise the spirit of self-sacrifice in a revolutionary drawn to violence and convert it into a soul force. This, in turn, led to an unprecedented thought revolution which not only resulted in India’s independence but sounded the death knell for European imperialism worldwide on one side and the most significant social reforms on the other—his work in the elimination of Untouchability, feudalism and Indenture system is unparalleled.

The Wrong Word Dictionary (English Improvement for Success),Dave Dowling,"Paperback,– 25 Apr 2019",3.7,14.0,"Unlike math and science, writing has very few absolutes. To that end, we're faced with making choices and many times those choices are word choices. Since I began teaching technical and business writing in industry years ago, one lesson never grew old an exercise on when to write the right word. Many writers confuse complement when they mean compliment, compose when they mean comprise, or assume when they mean presume. And hundreds of other mistaken word identities also exist. This Quick reference aims to filter this confusion of words. Remember, writing is much easier to comprehend when the noise around it is eliminated.
Though not inclusive of all word pair mistakes, this book speaks to the common word choices that challenge us daily. This book consists of more than 900 entries and the meanings of more than 2,000 individual words or phrases. Much of the content is based on word problems I've witnessed during my 25 years of business writing as well as the misuse commonly found in the online and print media. If you're looking for the basic homonyms such as to, too and two, or here and hear, you won't find them here. But you will find the basic pronoun possessives (their, they're, there, who's and whose and you're and your) because they still give us problems. I've tried to eliminate obvious synonyms (inedible vs. uneatable, simultaneous vs. concurrently, rare vs. scarce, etc.) and include just word pairs where the word distinction is still important yet challenging.
Note that a few entries may seem trivial and others may seem a bit obscure or obsolete. But overall you'll find it a good mix of problem words (among vs. between, flounder vs. founder, blatant vs. flagrant), Also included are a few notes on phrases that often lead to problem writing (between you and I, one of the only and others). For each entry in this reference, the difference between the words is explained and in most cases, a short and simple sentence example showing the correct usage is provided. The word definitions provided are intended strictly as guides and not dictionary definitions. They should help you differentiate between the words. Current dictionaries, popular writing books and reputable style guides were among the many' resources consulted for this book. The word list is arranged alphabetically according to the first word in the set. Always think about the words you use. Accuracy in word choice is a key to effective communication. In your daily writing, try to make sure you apply the right word for the right meaning. By doing so, its effect can affect your writing in a positive way.",Dictionaries,"Language, Linguistics & Writing",1.9590413923210936

Charles Darwin played a crucial part in turning heredity into a scientific question, and yet he failed spectacularly to answer it. The birth of genetics in the early 1900s seemed to do precisely that. Gradually, people translated their old notions about heredity into a language of genes. As the technology for studying genes became cheaper, millions of people ordered genetic tests to link themselves to missing parents, to distant ancestors, to ethnic identities . . . But, Zimmer argues, heredity isn’t just about genes that pass from parent to child. Heredity continues within our own bodies, as a single cell gives rise to trillions of cells that make up our bodies. We say we inherit genes from our ancestors – using a word that once referred to kingdoms and estates – but we inherit other things that matter as much or more to our lives, from microbes to technologies we use to make life more comfortable. We need a new definition of what heredity is and, through Carl Zimmer’s lucid exposition and storytelling, this resounding tour de force delivers it. Weaving together historical and current scientific research, his own experience with his two daughters, and the kind of original reporting expected of one of the world’s best science journalists, Zimmer ultimately unpacks urgent bioethical quandaries arising from new biomedical technologies, but also long-standing presumptions about who we really are and what we can pass on to future generations.",Journalism Books,"Language, Linguistics & Writing",2.77232170672292

In 'A Private Experience', a medical student hides from a violent riot with a poor Muslim woman whose dignity and faith force her to confront the realities and fears she's been pushing away.
In 'Tomorrow Is Too Far', a woman unlocks the devastating secret that surrounds her brother's death.
The young mother at the centre of 'Imitation' finds her comfortable life threatened when she learns that her husband back in Lagos has moved his mistress into their home.

The Untold Vajpayee: Politician and Paradox,Ullekh N P,"Hardcover,– 25 Dec 2016",3.7,27.0,"Despite his grand ‘secular’ statements in Parliament that bordered on the Nehruvian, Atal Bihari Vajpayee has often taken brief excursions into the hard-line camp. In 1983, he made an incendiary speech during the Assam elections in which the presence of ‘Bangladeshi foreigners’ in the state was a big issue. Even the BJP disowned Vajpayee’s speech, which possibly inspired the massacre of over 2000 people, mostly Muslims, in Nellie, Assam, the same year.
Vajpayee, one of the shrewdest politicians of India, is known for negotiating multiple paradoxes: from militant nationalism to his secret family life; his stint as a communist; his indulgence in food; and his attempt to project himself as a moderate, if not a liberal. Exploring crucial milestones of Vajpayee’s career and his traits as a seasoned politician, the book looks at his relationship with leaders of his party and his love–hate association with the RSS and its feeder organizations. Thoroughly researched, supported by hard facts and accompanied by inside stories and anecdotes, insightful interviews and archival photographs, The Untold Vajpayee will open a window to the life and times of a poet-politician.",Biographies & Autobiographies (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.5575072019056577

In fact, a whole lot of them out there don't identify with the idea of being a strong, independent, competitive saviour who never cries. As a boy, there is an assumption that you will conform to this stereotypical idea of masculinity, but what if you're the introvert kind, what if you prefer to pick up a book rather than a sword, what if you're very sensitive, what if you like the idea of wearing a dress?
As statistics keep showing that there is an ongoing crisis with regards to young men and mental health, with unhelpful gender stereotypes contributing to this malaise, Stories for Boys Who Dare To Be Different offers a welcome alternative narrative. It is an extraordinary compilation of 100 stories of famous and not-so-famous men from the past to the present day, every single one of them a rule-breaker and innovator in his own way, and all going on to achieve amazing things. Entries include Frank Ocean, Salvador Dali, Rimbaud, Beethoven, Barack Obama, Ai Weiwei and Jesse Owens - different sorts of heroes from all walks of life and from all over the world.

#SmallAngryPlanet
When Rosemary Harper joins the crew of the Wayfarer, she isn't expecting much. The ship, which has seen better days, offers her everything she could possibly want: a small, quiet spot to call home for a while, adventure in far-off corners of the galaxy, and distance from her troubled past.
But Rosemary gets more than she bargained for with the Wayfarer. The crew is a mishmash of species and personalities, from Sissix, the friendly reptillian pilot, to Kizzy and Jenks, the constantly sparring engineers who keep the ship running. Life on board is chaotic, but more or less peaceful - exactly what Rosemary wants.
Until the crew are offered the job of a lifetime: the chance to build a hyperspace tunnel to a distant planet. They'll earn enough money to live comfortably for years... if they survive the long trip through war-torn interstellar space without endangering any of the fragile alliances that keep the galaxy peaceful.
But Rosemary isn't the only person on board with secrets to hide, and the crew will soon discover that space may be vast, but spaceships are very small indeed.

Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life,Anne Lamott,"Paperback,– 1 Sep 1995",3.9,26.0,"A practical, helpful and funny guide to the phenomenal world of writing, Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott is one of the least preachy and actually applicable guides to writing, getting published, and to life at large. The author shells out instances from her own personal experiences and wisely yet wittily touches upon almost all areas of a writer’s world.
The book is subsumed under the simple scene of the author’s brother having to submit a project on birds, for which he is burdened with a plethora of books for research, and is clueless about where to start. Their father then comes to the rescue asking him to go ‘bird by bird’. This is exactly how Lamott tries to explain to the reader about the intricacies of the writing scenario and about getting published eventually, the key to which is to take it gradually.
From touching upon the concept of writer’s block, to the feelings of jealousy in the writer, to going broke with each paragraph, Lamott does it all in a humorous fashion. Both practical and profound, Anne Lamott’s Bird by Bird is useful for any budding or aspiring writer because of its sheer simplicity and timelessness. Moreover, the author not only sketches the real picture of a writer’s world, but also draws on her experiences to talk about humanity and about valuable lessons learnt from her own life.
The book was published by Anchor Books in 1995, and is available in paperback.

The Shining Mountain,Peter Boardman,"Paperback,– 19 Dec 2016",4.0,4.0,"`It's a preposterous plan. Still, if you do get up it, it'll be the hardest thing that's been done in the Himalayas.' So spoke Chris Bonington when Peter Boardman and Joe Tasker presented him with their plan to tackle the unclimbed West Wall of Changabang - the Shining Mountain - in 1976. Bonington's was one of the more positive responses; most felt the climb impossibly hard, especially for a two-man, lightweight expedition. This was, after all, perhaps the most fearsome and technically challenging granite wall in the Garhwal Himalaya and an ascent - particularly one in a lightweight style - would be more significant than anything done on Everest at the time. The idea had been Joe Tasker's. He had photographed the sheer, shining, white granite sweep of Changabang's West Wall on a previous expedition and asked Pete to return with him the following year. Tasker contributes a second voice throughout Boardman's story, which starts with acclimatisation, sleeping in a Salford frozen food store, and progresses through three nights of hell, marooned in hammocks during a storm, to moments of exultation at the variety and intricacy of the superb, if punishingly difficult, climbing. It is a story of how climbing a mountain can become an all-consuming goal, of the tensions inevitable in forty days of isolation on a two-man expedition; as well as a record of the moment of joy upon reaching the summit ridge against all odds. First published in 1978, The Shining Mountain is Peter Boardman's first book. It is a very personal and honest story that is also amusing, lucidly descriptive, very exciting, and never anything but immensely readable. It was awarded the John Llewelyn Rhys Prize for literature in 1979, winning wide acclaim. His second book, Sacred Summits, was published shortly after his death in 1982.",Geography Textbooks,Sports,2.8920946026904804

Awakening Bharat Mata: The Political Beliefs of the Indian Right,Swapan Dasgupta,"Hardcover,– 20 May 2019",3.5,2.0,"The rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was much more than an ordinary electoral phenomenon: it brought to the fore two contrasting views of nationhood: between those who saw modern India in terms of secular republicanism and on the other hand were those who sought to blend technological modernity with the country's Hindu inheritance. The Right's ascendancy and the debates that accompanied it, anticipated many of the concerns that find reflection today in the United States and Europe.
The phenomenon of Hindu nationalism was also a profound intellectual challenge to the loose Left-liberal consensus that had prevailed in India since Jawaharlal Nehru became Prime Minister in 1947. The idea of Hindutva and the political character of the BJP have been closely scrutinised by scholars, and the impulse has been to view India's Right-wing politics as either a variant of fascism or merely a collection of sectarian prejudices.
In fact, the inspiration for the Right in India has come from multiple and often contradictory sources, including the influence of individuals such as Sarvarkar, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Swami Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo, not to mention the Arya Samaj movement.
This collection is an attempt to showcase the phenomenon of Hindu nationalism in terms of how it perceives itself. Many of the concerns that drive the Indian Right are located in the country's nationalist culture. In trying to locate some of the ideas, attitudes and beliefs that define the Indian Right, Awakening Bharat Mata also seeks to identify the nature of Indian conservatism and identify its similarities and differences with political thought in the West.
This book is not about Hindu nationalism in power but as a social and political movement and its aim is to encourage a more informed understanding of an idea that will remain relevant in Indian life far beyond victories and defeats in elections.",Political Ideologies (Books),Politics,2.6242820958356683

Play The Forest School Way: Woodland Games and Crafts for Adventurous Kids,"Jane Worroll, Peter Houghton","Paperback,– 24 May 2016",5.0,,"Help your child connect with nature, be adventurous and most of all have fun, with these woodland games, crafts and other activities from Forest School.

The rise of the Forest School movement in recent years is part of a groundswell of concern about the wellbeing of our children, with many media scare stories about child obesity, ""nature deficit disorder"" (as described in Last Child in the Woods) and lack of exposure to risk.

This woodland adventure book brings the activities and--learning through nature--ethos of Forest School to the parents of nursery and primary school-age children. It's packed full of ideas, from making nature jewellery and whittling a bow and arrow to building a shelter and foraging for food; it also celebrates the Forest School philosophy of encouraging self-esteem, confidence and social skills through engagement with nature. As well as sharing Forest School's brilliant ideas for activities, this book encourages parents to follow aspects of the Forest School approach in the way they handle play sessions; in, for example, getting adults to engage actively while being careful to let the kids lead; in framing sessions with small rituals).

Activity variations target different age groups, and there are ideas for small groups (for play dates, for example, or children's birthday parties) as well as things to do with just one or two children. While the book is aimed at parents, who are encouraged to guide the play, the activity instructions are written in a simple style so that children can read them too, and the illustrations are also intended to be enjoyed by children. With a fun, child-friendly design, this book offers an immersive experience for all the family. The book is designed to be robust enough to withstand outdoor handling while also being attractive as a gift for ""green"" parents, with charming illustrations and a retro design that together create a magical feel and chime with the back-to-nature content.","Handicrafts, Decorative Arts & Crafts (Books)",Sports,3.000434077479319

Will Bridgette find it in herself to warm her heart to Warren and finally learn to love?

South by Java Head,Alistair MacLean,"Paperback,– Special Edition, 6 May 2008",4.4,7.0,"The 50th anniversary edition of this classic World War 2 adventure set in south-east Asia.
February, 1942: Singapore lies burning and shattered, defenceless before the conquering hordes of the Japanese Army, as the last boat slips out of the harbour into the South China Sea. On board are a desperate group of people, each with a secret to guard, each willing to kill to keep that secret safe.
Who or what is the dissolute Englishman, Farnholme? The elegant Dutch planter, Van Effen? The strangely beautiful Eurasian girl, Gudrun? The slave trader, Siran? The smiling and silent Nicholson who is never without his gun? Only one thing is certain: the rotting tramp steamer is a floating death trap, carrying a cargo of human TNT.
Dawn sees them far out to sea but with the first murderous dive bombers already aimed at their ship. Thus begins an ordeal few are to survive, a nightmare succession of disasters wrought by the hell-bent Japanese, the unrelenting tropical sun and by the survivors themselves, whose hatred and bitterness divides them one against the other.
Written after the acclaimed and phenomenally successful HMS Ulysses and The Guns of Navarone, this was MacLean’s third book, and it contains all the hallmarks of those other two classics.

Devadatta,Osamu Tezuka,"Paperback,– 28 Oct 2010",3.2,2.0,"The third book in the classic eight volume graphic novel series retelling the story of Buddha, from the godfather of the genre.
In the third of the Buddha series, as Siddhartha embarks on his journey towards enlightenment, he encounters many influences; some forceful, like the monk Dhepa who believes that purity is only attained through ordeals of the flesh, and some inspirational, like the strange young acolyte, Assaji.
Meanwhile, Devadatta, the young orphaned son of Bandaka, is forced along a cruel path. Choosing to reject humanity and compassion, Devadatta’s journey will mould him into Buddha’s greatest adversary.
Originated in the 1970s, Buddha is Osamu Tezuka's unparalleled rendition of the life and times of Prince Siddhartha.
Tezuka's storytelling genius and consummate skill at visual expression blossom fully as he contextualizes the Buddha's ideas; with an emphasis on, action, emotion, humour and conflict as Prince Siddhartha runs away from home, travels across India and questions Hindu practices such as ascetic self-mutilation and caste oppression.
Rather than recommend resignation and impassivity, Tezuka's Buddha predicates enlightenment upon recognizing the interconnectedness of life, having compassion for the suffering, and ordering one's life sensibly, his approach is slightly irreverent in that it incorporates something that Western commentators often eschew, namely, humour.",Comics & Graphic Novels (Books),Comics & Mangas,2.5477747053878224

Love and Freindship: And Other Youthful Writings (Penguin Clothbound Classics),Jane Austen,"Hardcover,– 27 Jan 2015",1.0,2.0,"Austen’s hilarious early stories and sketches—complete with her delightfully quirky spelling habits—now collected in one gorgeous clothbound volume, including Lady Susan, the basis for Whit Stillman's feature film Love and Friendship starring Kate Beckinsale and Chloë Sevigny

Jane Austen’s earliest writing dates from when she was just eleven-years-old, and already shows the hallmarks of her mature work. But it is also a product of the times in which she grew up—dark, grotesque, often surprisingly bawdy, and a far cry from the polished, sparkling novels of manners for which she became famous. Drunken heroines, babies who bite off their mothers’ fingers, and a letter-writer who has murdered her whole family all feature in these highly spirited pieces. This edition includes all of Austen’s juvenilia, including her “History of England” and the novella Lady Susan, in which the anti-heroine schemes and cheats her way through high society. With a title that captures a young Austen’s original idiosyncratic spelling habits and an introduction by Christine Alexander that shows how Austen was self-consciously fashioning herself as a writer from an early age, this is a must-have for any Austen lover.",Anthologies (Books),Humour,2.929929560084588

Soon, not only is she eating her own homemade bread, she's providing loaves daily to the General Dexterity cafeteria. The company chef urges her to take her product to the farmer's market, and a whole new world opens up.

The war has begun…
For time out of mind, bloodthirsty demons have stalked the night, culling the human race to scattered remnants dependent on half-forgotten magics to protect them.
Two heroes arose―men as close as brothers, yet divided by bitter betrayal. Arlen Bales became known as the Painted Man, tattooed head-to-toe with powerful magic symbols that enable him to fight demons in hand-to-hand combat―and emerge victorious. Ahmann Jardir, armed with magically warded weapons, called himself the Deliverer, a figure prophesied to unite humanity and lead them to triumph in Sharak Ka―the final war against demonkind.
But in their efforts to bring the war to the demons, Arlen and Jardir have set something in motion that may prove the end of everything they hold dear―a Swarm. Now the war is at hand, and humanity cannot hope to win it unless Arlen and Jardir, with the help of Arlen’s wife, Renna, can bend a captured demon prince to their will and force the devious creature to lead them to the Core, where the Mother of Demons breeds an inexhaustible army.
Trusting their closest confidantes, Leesha, Inevera, Ragen, and Elissa, to rally the fractious people of the Free Cities and lead them against the Swarm, Arlen, Renna, and Jardir set out on a desperate quest into the darkest depths of evil―from which none of them expects to return alive.",Action & Adventure (Books),Action & Adventure,2.8627275283179747

Yoga for Runners,Lexie Williamson,"Paperback,– 2015",5.0,5.0,"Yoga for Runners uses yoga postures to both stretch and lengthen those short, tight running muscles in a way that is time-efficient and highly targeted.
Running is a fantastic cardiovascular workout that floods the body with endorphins and many runners find its rhythmic, meditative nature a natural stress reliever. The downside of repetitive motion, however, is that it taxes select groups of muscles (hamstrings, quadriceps, hip flexors and Achilles) and neglects the remainder. This leads to muscular imbalances and, eventually, injury.
Yoga for Runners addresses these imbalances by using yoga postures to both effectively stretch and lengthen these over-taxed muscles.
As in yoga, it's a union of all these physical and mental aspects that affect the performance of the runner as a whole. Practice the techniques together to become a stronger, smoother runner who is less prone to injury. Breathe deeper and more efficiently to train for longer. Gain a clear head to tackle negative distractions as you train or race, and in life generally.",Healthy Living & Wellness (Books),Sports,3.162564406523019

Sap Hr Personnel Administration and Recruitment: Technical Reference and Learning Guide,Agrawal P.K,"Paperback,– 2011",5.0,2.0,"SAP is a great software. One needs to fully understand its features in order to effectively exploit them for the benefit of customers. Mr. Agrawal's books on SAP HR have a unique approach. A chapter usually focuses on a single business concept, and discusses the user interface as well as its associated configuration. This logical division makes it easier for readers to understand the functionality. Another important feature of these books is the level of detail. Each screen and each field in a screen is explained. Explanation includes meaning, use case and in some cases guidelines. Details are balanced by overviews explaining the concepts and their relationships. While explaining functionality, Mr. Agrawal has made efforts to highlight what can be done and how it is to be done. This is particularly important for less experienced users and consultants. Indicating chapter numbers against each menu and configuration item is a very useful innovation, as it establishes direct link between the SAP system and the book. Another useful feature is that these books can be read not only by consultants, but also by users, business process owners and even by senior managers. The importance of each topic for each category of users is specified. Mr. Agrawal has taken considerable pains in writing these books, and I congratulate Mr. Agrawal on his achievement and thank him for his contribution to the SAP community.",Business Communication,"Computing, Internet & Digital Media",2.6532125137753435
That Good Night: Life and Medicine in the Eleventh Hour,Sunita Puri,"Paperback,– 16 Apr 2019",5.0,,"'A profound meditation on a problem many of us will face; worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Atul Gawande's Being Mortal' Kirkus
As the American born daughter of immigrants, Dr. Sunita Puri knew from a young age that the gulf between her parents' experiences and her own was impossible to bridge, save for two elements: medicine and spirituality. Between days spent waiting for her mother, an anesthesiologist, to exit the OR, and evenings spent in conversation with her parents about their faith, Puri witnessed the tension between medicine's impulse to preserve life at all costs and a spiritual embrace of life's temporality. And it was that tension that eventually drew Puri, a passionate but unsatisfied medical student, to palliative medicine - a new specialty attempting to translate the border between medical intervention and quality-of-life care.
Interweaving evocative stories of Puri's family and the patients she cares for, That Good Night is a stunning meditation on impermanence and the role of medicine in helping us to live and die well, arming readers with information that will transform how we communicate with our doctors about what matters most to us.

THE BRILLIANT AND CONTROVERSIAL CRITIQUE OF AMERICAN CULTURE WITH NEARLY A MILLION COPIES IN PRINT

 In 1987, eminent political philosopher Allan Bloom published The Closing of the American Mind, an appraisal of contemporary America that “hits with the approximate force and effect of electroshock therapy” (The New York Times) and has not only been vindicated, but has also become more urgent today. In clear, spirited prose, Bloom argues that the social and political crises of contemporary America are part of a larger intellectual crisis: the result of a dangerous narrowing of curiosity and exploration by the university elites.

Now, in this twenty-fifth anniversary edition, acclaimed author and journalist Andrew Ferguson contributes a new essay that describes why Bloom’s argument caused such a furor at publication and why our culture so deeply resists its truths today.",Political Ideologies (Books),Politics,2.9242792860618816

There are also brief sections on the pictography and ideography of the Sioux and Ojibway tribes, and on smoke signals.
This is a book for anyone who wants to learn or teach Indian sign language — scouts, school teachers, camp counselors, scout leaders, parents, linguists, and students of Indian culture. To help counselors and teachers, the last chapters give instructions on how to conduct the Indian ceremony for opening a council fire, an Indian initiation ceremony, and suggestions for sign language tests and exercises.",Sign Language Reference,Humour,2.545307116465824

This book is based on the incident and aims at finding out who was the culprit of these murders and the motive behind it.

Everything Happens for a Reason: And Other Lies I've Loved,Kate Bowler,"Hardcover,– Import, 6 Feb 2018",3.4,11.0,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “A meditation on sense-making when there’s no sense to be made, on letting go when we can’t hold on, and on being unafraid even when we’re terrified.”—Lucy Kalanithi

“Belongs on the shelf alongside other terrific books about this difficult subject, like Paul Kalanithi’s When Breath Becomes Air and Atul Gawande’s Being Mortal.”—Bill Gates

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY REAL SIMPLE

Kate Bowler is a professor at Duke Divinity School with a modest Christian upbringing, but she specializes in the study of the prosperity gospel, a creed that sees fortune as a blessing from God and misfortune as a mark of God’s disapproval. At thirty-five, everything in her life seems to point toward “blessing.” She is thriving in her job, married to her high school sweetheart, and loves life with her newborn son.

Then she is diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer.

The prospect of her own mortality forces Kate to realize that she has been tacitly subscribing to the prosperity gospel, living with the conviction that she can control the shape of her life with “a surge of determination.” Even as this type of Christianity celebrates the American can-do spirit, it implies that if you “can’t do” and succumb to illness or misfortune, you are a failure. Kate is very sick, and no amount of positive thinking will shrink her tumors. What does it mean to die, she wonders, in a society that insists everything happens for a reason? Kate is stripped of this certainty only to discover that without it, life is hard but beautiful in a way it never has been before.

Frank and funny, dark and wise, Kate Bowler pulls the reader deeply into her life in an account she populates affectionately with a colorful, often hilarious retinue of friends, mega-church preachers, relatives, and doctors. Everything Happens for a Reason tells her story, offering up her irreverent, hard-won observations on dying and the ways it has taught her to live.

Praise for Everything Happens for a Reason
 
“I fell hard and fast for Kate Bowler. Her writing is naked, elegant, and gripping—she’s like a Christian Joan Didion. I left Kate’s story feeling more present, more grateful, and a hell of a lot less alone.

Somewhere on a rocky patch of the sun-drenched Italian coastline a young innkeeper, chest-deep in daydreams, looks out over the incandescent waters of the Ligurian Sea and views an apparition: a beautiful woman, a vision in white, approaching him on a boat. She is an American starlet, he soon learns, and she is dying.
And the story begins again today, half a world away in Hollywood, when an elderly Italian man shows up on a movie studio's back lot searching for the woman he last saw at his hotel fifty years before.
Gloriously inventive, funny, tender and constantly surprising, Beautiful Ruins is a novel full of fabulous and yet very flawed people, all of them striving towards another sort of life, a future that is both delightful and yet, tantalizingly, seems just out of reach.

But this pulse-pounding narrative is also a nuanced story of how colonialism and environmental destruction upset the natural order, placing man, tiger and nature on a collision course.
In Champawat, India, circa 1900, a Bengal tigress was wounded by a poacher in the forests of the Himalayan foothills. Unable to hunt her usual prey, the tiger began stalking and eating an easier food source: human beings. Between 1900 and 1907, the Champawat Man-Eater, as she became known, emerged as the most prolific serial killer of human beings the world has ever known, claiming an astonishing 436 lives.
Desperate for help, authorities appealed to renowned local hunter Jim Corbett, an Indian-born Brit of Irish descent, who was intimately familiar with the Champawat forest. Corbett, who would later earn fame and devote the latter part of his life to saving the Bengal tiger and its habitat, sprang into action. Like a detective on the tail of a serial killer, he tracked the tiger’s movements, as the tiger began to hunt him in return.
This was the beginning of Corbett’s life-long love of tigers, though his first encounter with the Champawat Tiger would be her last.",True Accounts (Books),Sports,2.806179973983887

How Fascism Works,Jason Stanley,"Hardcover,– 10 Nov 2018",4.0,,"Fascist politics seeks to divide a population along ethnic, racial, or religious lines. Jason Stanley understood this as a scholar of philosophy and propaganda and as the child of refugees of WWII Europe, but even he was surprised by its prevalence in the United States. First with the rise of the birther movement and later the ascent of Donald Trump, he observed that not only is the rise of fascist politics possible in America, but its roots have been here for more than a century. Drawing on history, philosophy, sociology, critical race theory, and examples from around the world from 19th-century America to 20th-century Germany (where Hitler was inspired by the Confederacy and Jim Crow South) to 21st-century India--Stanley identifies the ten pillars of fascist politics that leaders use to hold onto power by dividing populations into an us and a them: the mythic past, propaganda, anti-intellectualism, unreality, hierarchy, victimhood, law and order, sexual anxiety, appeals to the heartland, and a dismantling of public welfare and unity. He uncovers urgent patterns that are widespread today and pins down a creeping sense that fascist tendencies are on the rise. By recognizing them, he argues, readers might begin to resist their most harmful effects.",Political Ideologies (Books),Politics,2.7781512503836434

Powder Room: The Untold Story of Indian Fashion,Shefalee Vasudev,"Hardcover,– 1 Jul 2012",5.0,4.0,"About The Book
Ever been intrigued by the Indian Fashion Industry—its stereotypes of drugged models, gay designers, and fascinating but unaffordable clothes?
Join Shefalee Vasudev, former editor of Marie Claire and an acclaimed fashion journalist, on a deep‑sea dive into the gagging depths of Indian fashion. In Powder Room, she offers an insider’s view of people who make the industry what it is—from a lower middle class girl who sells global luxury for a living to a designer who fights the inner demons of child sexual abuse yet manages to survive and thrive in the business of fashion, or a Ludhiana housewife on a perpetual fashion high.
Besides candid interviews of known names in Indian fashion, Shefalee provides a commentary on new social behaviour, urban culture, generational differences, and the compulsions behind conspicuous consumption in a country splitting at the seams with inequalities of opportunity and wealth. From Nagaland to Patan, Mumbai, Delhi, and Punjab, Powder Room mirrors how and why India ‘does’ fashion.

Fire and Blood: A History of the Targaryen Kings from Aegon the Conqueror to Aegon III as scribed by Archmaester Gyldayn,George R.R. Martin,"Hardcover,– 20 Nov 2018",4.2,41.0,"Set 300 years before the events in A Song of Ice and Fire, FIRE AND BLOOD is the definitive history of the Targaryens in Westeros as told by Archmaester Gyldayn and chronicles the conquest that united the Seven Kingdoms under Targaryen rule through to the Dance of the Dragons: the Targaryen civil war that nearly ended their dynasty forever.

The thrilling history of the Targaryens comes to life in this masterly work by the author of A Song of Ice and Fire, the inspiration for HBO’s Game of Thrones.

With all the fire and fury fans have come to expect from internationally bestselling author George R.R. Martin, this is the first volume of the definitive two-part history of the Targaryens in Westeros.

Centuries before the events of A Game of Thrones, House Targaryen – the only family of dragon lords to survive the Doom of Valyria – took up residence on Dragonstone. Fire and Blood begins their tale with the legendary Aegon the Conqueror, creator of the Iron Throne and goes on to recount the generations of Targaryens who fought to hold that iconic seat, all the way up to the civil war that nearly tore their dynasty apart.

What really happened during the Dance of the Dragons? Why did it become so deadly to visit Valyria after the Doom? What is the origin of Daenerys’s three dragon eggs? These are but a few of the questions answered in this essential chronicle, as related by a learned maester of the Citadel and featuring more than eighty all-new black-and-white illustrations by artist Doug Wheatley. Readers have glimpsed small parts of this narrative in such volumes as The World of Ice and Fire but now, for the first time, the full tapestry of Targaryen history is revealed.

With all the scope and grandeur of Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Fire and Blood is the ultimate game of thrones, giving readers a whole new appreciation for the dynamic, often bloody and always fascinating history of Westeros.",Action & Adventure (Books),Action & Adventure,2.7558748556724915

`I treat the narrative of the Lives as a kind of mirror...The experience is like nothing so much as spending time in their company and living with them: I receive and welcome each of them in turn as my guest.'

In the nine lives of this collection Plutarch introduces the reader to the major figures and periods of classical Greece. He portrays virtues to be emulated and vices to be avoided, but his purpose is also implicitly to educate and warn those in his own day who wielded power. In prose that is rich, elegant and sprinkled with learned references, he explores with an extraordinary degree of insight the interplay of character and political action. While drawing chiefly on historical sources, he brings to biography a natural story-teller's ear for a good anecdote.

Throughout the ages Plutarch's Lives have been valued for their historical value and their charm. This new translation will introduce new generations to his urbane erudition. The most comprehensive selection available, it is accompanied by a lucid introduction, explanatory notes, bibliographies, maps and indexes.

It is now abundantly clear that Sacks has never stopped going. From its opening pages on his youthful obsession with motorcycles and speed, On the Move is infused with his restless energy. As he recounts his experiences as a young neurologist in the early 1960s, first in California and then in New York, where he discovered a long forgotten illness in the back wards of a chronic hospital, as well as with a group of patients who would define his life, it becomes clear that Sacks' earnest desire for engagement has occasioned unexpected encounters and travels - sending him through bars and alleys, over oceans, and across continents. With unbridled honesty and humour, Sacks shows us that the same energy that drives his physical passions - bodybuilding, weightlifting, and swimming - also drives his cerebral passions. He writes about his love affairs, both romantic and intellectual, his guilt over leaving his family to come to America, his bond with his schizophrenic brother, and the writers and scientists - A.R. Luria, W.H. Auden, Francis Crick - who influenced him. On the Move is the story of a brilliantly unconventional physician and writer - and of the man who has illuminated the many ways that the brain makes us human.",Action & Adventure (Books),Action & Adventure,2.8115750058705933

Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built,Duncan Clark,"Hardcover,– 18 Apr 2016",4.2,157.0,"In just a decade and half Jack Ma, a man who rose from humble beginnings and started his career as an English teacher, founded and built Alibaba into the second largest Internet company in the world. The company’s $25 billion IPO in 2014 was the world’s largest, valuing the company more than Facebook or Coca Cola. Alibaba today runs the e-commerce services that hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers depend on every day, providing employment and income for tens of millions more. A Rockefeller of his age, Jack has become an icon for the country’s booming private sector and as the face of the new, consumerist China is courted by heads of state and CEOs from around the world.

Granted unprecedented access to a wealth of new material including exclusive interviews, Clark draws on his own first-hand experience of key figures integral to Alibaba’s rise to create an authoritative, compelling narrative account of how Alibaba and its charismatic creator have transformed the way that Chinese exercise their new found economic freedom, inspiring entrepreneurs around the world and infuriating others, turning the tables on the Silicon Valley giants who have tried to stand in his way.

Duncan explores vital questions about the company’s past, present and future: How, from such unremarkable origins, did Jack Ma build Alibaba? What explains his relentless drive and his ability to outsmart his competitors? With over 80% of China’s e-commerce market, how long can the company hope to maintain its dominance? As the company sets its sights on the country’s financial and media markets, are there limits to Alibaba’s ambitions, or will the Chinese government act to curtail them? And as it set up shop from LA and San Francisco to Seattle, how will Alibaba grow its presence and investments in the US and other international markets?

Clark tells Alibaba’s tale within the wider story of China’s economic explosion—the rise of the private sector and the expansion of Internet usage—that haver powered the country’s rise to become the world’s second largest economy and largest Internet population, twice the size of the United States. He also explores the political and social context for these momentous changes. An expert insider with unrivalled connections, Clark has a deep understanding of Chinese business mind-set. He illuminates an unlikely corporate titan as never before and examines the key role his company has played in transforming China while increasing its power and presence worldwide.",Industries & Business Sectors (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.5538830266438746

People were asking themselves by what right these aliens had overrun British soil. An ever-growing feeling of annoyance had begun to lay hold of the nation.”

Clarence Chugwater is not a Boy Scout for nothing. It is summer 1909 and everyone is too interested in the Test Match to notice that England has been invaded by the Germans. And the Russians. And the Chinese. Not to mention a ‘boisterous band of the Young Turks’, a mad Mullah, and a brace of North African pirates. The government has recently abolished the army so there is nothing to be done about it anyway, except give a masterly display of polite indifference. But this would be to reckon without patriotic Clarence, ‘Boy of Destiny’, who alone is prepared to stand up to the foe, and who devises a highly unorthodox plan to restore his country to freedom…

The Swoop! Or, How Clarence Saved England reprints the 33 black and white drawings by C. Harrison that accompanied the first edition.

A fascinating description of an era of cultural transition, this nineteenth-century masterpiece was to become the most influential interpretation of the Italian Renaissance, and anticipated ideas such as Nietzsche's concept of the 'Ubermensch' in its portrayal of an age of genius.

 When girl meets Duke, their marriage breaks all the rules…
Since his return from war, the Duke of Ashbury’s to-do list has been short and anything but sweet: brooding, glowering, menacing London ne’er-do-wells by night. Now there’s a new item on the list. He needs an heir—which means he needs a wife. When Emma Gladstone, a vicar’s daughter turned seamstress, appears in his library wearing a wedding gown, he decides on the spot that she’ll do.
His terms are simple:
- They will be husband and wife by night only.
- No lights, no kissing. 
- No questions about his battle scars.
- Last, and most importantly… Once she’s pregnant with his heir, they need never share a bed again.
But Emma is no pushover. She has a few rules of her own:
- They will have dinner together every evening.
- With conversation.
- And unlimited teasing.
- Last, and most importantly… Once she’s seen the man beneath the scars, he can’t stop her from falling in love…",Romance (Books),Romance,2.724275869600789

On Photography (Penguin Modern Classics),Susan Sontag,"Paperback,– 25 Sep 2008",4.5,9.0,"Susan Sontag's On Photography is a seminal and groundbreaking work on the subject.
Susan Sontag's groundbreaking critique of photography asks forceful questions about the moral and aesthetic issues surrounding this art form. Photographs are everywhere, and the 'insatiability of the photographing eye' has profoundly altered our relationship with the world. Photographs have the power to shock, idealize or seduce, they create a sense of nostalgia and act as a memorial, and they can be used as evidence against us or to identify us. In these six incisive essays, Sontag examines the ways in which we use these omnipresent images to manufacture a sense of reality and authority in our lives.
'Sontag offers enough food for thought to satisfy the most intellectual of appetites'The Times
'A brilliant analysis of the profound changes photographic images have made in our way of looking at the world, and at ourselves'Washington Post
'The most original and illuminating study of the subject'New Yorker
One of America's best-known and most admired writers, Susan Sontag was also a leading commentator on contemporary culture until her death in December 2004.

Chaos Monkeys: Inside the Silicon Valley Money Machine,Antonio Garcia Martinez,"Paperback,– Import, 1 Jun 2017",4.5,15.0,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER

An adrenaline-fuelled exposé of life inside the tech bubble, Chaos Monkeys lays bare the secrets, power plays and lifestyle excesses of the visionaries, grunts, sociopaths, opportunists and money cowboys who are revolutionising our world. Written by startup CEO and industry provocateur Antonio García Martínez, this is Liar’s Poker meets The Social Network.

Computer engineers use ‘chaos monkey’ software to wreak havoc and test system robustness. Similarly, tech entrepreneurs like Antonio García Martínez are society’s chaos monkeys – their innovations disrupt every aspect of our lives, from transportation (Uber) and holidays (Airbnb) to television (Netflix) and dating (Tinder) – all in search of the perfect business miracle.

Describing himself as ‘high-strung, fast-talking, and wired on a combination of caffeine, fear, and greed at all times’, García Martínez left Wall Street to make his fortune in Silicon Valley, becoming CEO of his own startup, before bailing and being poached by Facebook’s nascent advertising team. Here he turned users’ data into profit for COO Sheryl Sandberg and chairman and CEO Mark ‘Zuck’ Zuckerberg. Forced out of Facebook in the wake of a bitter internal product war, García Martínez took his unique brand of entrepreneurial hyperactivity to rivals Twitter. Along the way, he got into a lot of trouble with a lot of people, brewed illegal beer on the Facebook campus (accidentally flooding Zuckerberg's desk), lived on a yacht, raced sport cars on the highway, and enthusiastically pursued the lifestyle of an overpaid Silicon Valley mercenary.

In Chaos Monkeys he tells you HOW – and HOW NOT – to make a fortune through startups and digital marketing. Highly entertaining and always offering genuine insight, García Martínez unravels the chaotic evolution of social media and online marketing. From startups and credit derivatives to Big Brother and data tracking, social media monetisation and digital ‘privacy’, he shares both his scathing observations and outrageous antics, taking us on a subversive and very funny tour of the fascinatingly insular and unbelievably wealthy tech industry.",Sales,"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.5477747053878224

The Man Who Saved India,Hindol Sengupta,"Hardcover,– 31 Aug 2018",4.7,36.0,"There is perhaps no political figure in modern history who did more to secure and protect the Indian nation than Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. But, ironically, seventy years after Patel brought together piece by piece the map of India by fusing the princely states with British India to create a new democratic, independent nation, little is understood or appreciated about Patel's enormous contribution to the making of India. Caricatured in political debate, all the nuances of Patel's difficult life and the daring choices he made are often lost, or worse, used as mere polemic. If Mahatma Gandhi was the spiritual core of India's freedom struggle and Jawaharlal Nehru its romantic idealism, it was Sardar Patel who brought in the vital pragmatism which held together the national movement and the first ideas of independent India. A naturally stoic man, Patel, unlike Gandhi or Nehru, wrote no personal history. He famously argued that its was better to create history than write it. This is why even his deepest misgivings and quarrels have been easily buried. But every warning that Patel left for India - from the dangers of allowing groups to create private militias to his thoughtful criticism on India's approach to Kashmir, Pakistan and China - are all dangerously relevant today. It is impossible to read about Patel, who died in 1950, and not feel that had he lived on, India might have been a different country. It is also impossible to ignore Patel and understand not only what the idea of India is but also what it could have been, and might be in the future. The Man Who Saved India is a sweeping, magisterial retelling of Sardar Patel's story. With fiercely detailed and pugnacious anecdotes, multiple award-winning, best-selling writer Hindol Sengupta brings alive Patel's determined life of struggle and his furious commitment to keep India safe. This book brings alive all the arguments, quarrels and clashes between some of the most determined people in Indian history and their battle to carve out an independent nation.

Praise for the book:
Sardar Patel was the silent one of the trinity along with Gandhi and Nehru who dedicated his life. In the struggle for an independent India. His lasting legacy is a United India rather than the land which throughout history has-been split in rival warring kingdoms. Hindol Sengupta has given us the story of Sardar's life for the new generations of India so that they could understand and admire a unique personality. Read this book and discover India's history in the first half the last century. And reclaim your legacy.
- Lord Meghnad Desai, bestselling author and economist
""It is dangerous to put dreamers in power. Sardar Patel's pragmatism was the perfect antidote to Nehru's idealism in the early years of Independence. If only Patel had lived longer, India would have been spared the excesses of the License Raj and the Kashmir problem. This is one of the messages of this lively, highly readable book.""
- Gurcharan Das, bestselling author
The Man Who Saved India is the most authoritative and accessible biography of Sardhar Vallabhbhai Patel, lovingly referred to as the 'Iron Man of India'. In this book, written in his impeccable narrative style, Hindol Sengupta rescues the memory of the beloved leader of India from the vaults of obscurity. This book brings out the true story of independence as well as stability of India following it, which was achieved through sweat and blood of its leaders like Patel.
The Man who Saved India reverses one of the historical ironies of modern India through bringing into light many of the unknown facts of the life of Patel, based on the author's field visits, interviews, and extensive research, which is an onerous task in itself considering the fact that Patel neither maintained records of his work nor preserved his documents of communications.
Hindol begins the narration of larger than life tale of Patel describing his visit to the birth home of Patel in Nadiad, now in dilapidated condition, an image not unlike the less than optimal public memory of Patel in modern India.
Hindol discusses the numerous sacrifices Patel has made in public life bowing to the political ambitions of his peers, while never wavering from his duty to India. The Man who Saved India clearly charts the leadership skills and statesmanship of Patel during the numerous non-cooperation and civil disobedience movements such as Bardoli and Kheda Satyagrahas, and the timely military action in independent India. It was due to the sheer strength of resolve on the part of Patel, which has helped forge the Bharat that was to capture the imagination of the masses of independent India.
The hitherto unknown details of Patel's personal life and his complex relations with his peers and other contemporary national leaders including Gandhi, Nehru, and Bose, help understand the grace with which he gave up political positions more than once. In addition, the author also clearly describes the personal sacrifices Patel has made at the altar of mother India, not only of his personal life, but also of the life of his children, even to the chagrin of his family and friends.
The amazing result of author's copious research is the emergence of an exceptionally clear picture of Patel's life and leadership in the three decades leading up to the independence of India in addition to establishing Patel's key role in the formative years of India following independence, until his death. The Man who Saved India is a timely and much needed historical account of modern India.
The Man who Saved India is a must read for every Indian as well as every person interested in learning the true history of India.

Every nation has its own narrative that is built over time, even centuries. For India and as Indians we claim ancient ancestry and are therefore, civilisational. Yet, we are a new democratic republic trying to find our place in the new tumultuous 21st century.
There comes a time when we cannot look forward without revisiting our past to see if the narrative of the past was complete, accurate and fair. For decades, the narrative has been that there were essentially two leaders in India - Mahatma Gandhi and his protégé Jawahar Lal Nehru, who together had led the country to independence. Their contribution to the cause of independence was monumental and this became the widely accepted truth. Yet there was another truth, long ignored in our national narrative.
Hindol Sengupta's book, The Man Who Saved India, provides the other truth. In a meticulously and extensively researched book, the young author brings to the reader the significant role that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played not only in our struggle for independence but in the consolidation of the new country. Valabhbhai Patel was truly a part of the Trinity, along with Mahatma Gandhi and Jawahar Lal, that led India to freedom. He was the man who ensured that this newfound independence did not collapse in a heap of dust. It was the Sardar who dealt with the reluctant Maharajas, Nawabs and the obdurate Nizam of Hyderabad, when they dreamt of returning to their feudal opulence outside modern India. Patel liquidated the princely states without liquidating the princes. It was his commitment, diplomatic and political skills along with the force of his personality that made unified India a reality.
The book begins with a description of what was once the ancestral home of this great man of India. This decrepit and rather lonely state of the house and its utter neglect is a clear indication that the prevalent narrative preferred to ignore Valabhbhai Patel's contribution. Gandhi knew the value of God and religion in an India that was subjugated. Nehru knew that if India had to talk about its future then there had to be a grand past of aloofness and elitism. It was Patel who was the hard realist who knew that democracy was not about daily plebiscites but hard decisions cloaked in egalitarianism. Nehru looked at the heavens for inspiration Patel looked at the ground beneath his feet for solutions. While Nehru wrote elegant prose and Gandhi spoke to the masses, it was left to Patel to worry over mundane matters about funds and their distribution. Patel was a man of few words and there is every reason to give him credit today for many of his arguments and ideas ranging from tackling Kashmir, the future of Pakistan and how socialism without industrialization could be dangerous for the country. His warnings about Kashmir, Tibet and China went unheeded.
The book is thus not only one of the finest biographies in recent times but is also a much-needed redefining of the roles played by Sardar Patel during India's freedom movement and as the great unifier. The author argues that Patel was not only a pillar of strength behind some of Gandhi's earlier successes to holding the country together.
The author quotes Patel's speech on 5 July 1947 where he warned, ""Our mutual conflicts and internecine quarrels and jealousies have in the past been the cause of our downfall and our falling victim to foreign domination a number of times. We cannot afford to fall into these errors or traps again."" Sardar Patel was relevant then as he is today. So is Hindol Sengupta's book.
- Vikram Sood, bestselling author and the former head of India's foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing
The Man Who Saved India is an excellent deep dive into the life and struggles of one of the tallest leaders in Indian history. Hindol Sengupta written a fascinating book full of insights on things that are rarely discussed - for instance, Patel's economic ideas or his key role as the man who raised critical funds for the Congress Party. This captivating book breaks many myths and throws new light on one of the most important figures in Indian history.
- Vijay Govindarajan, NYT and Wall Street Journal bestselling author, Coxe Distinguished Professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College
A very engaging biography of Sardar Patel, the man and his times, by one of India's best young writers
- Sanjeev Sanyal, bestselling author and Principal Economic Advisor, Ministry of Finance, Government of India
The genre of popular history and biography has been experiencing a golden age and Hindol Sengupta's fluent biography of Sardar Vallabhai Patel joins a list of distinguished titles alongside Michael Axworthy's Sword of Persia, Nadir Shah and Roger Crowley's Constantinople, The Last Great Siege, 1453. Very welcome indeed that an eminently accessible account of the life and achievements of one of India's true great sons is now available to a new generation of readers.
- Gautam Sen, lecturer (retd.), London School of Economics and co-author of Analysing the Global Political Economy, Princeton University Press, 2009.
Rich with detail and illuminating insight, Hindol Sengupta's The Man Who Saved India brings alive Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's indomitable spirit and tenacity in the face of constant challenges that would crush a weaker man. Few people immediately think of Patel when they think of men responsible for the shape and form of modern India. This is a great injustice, for, as Hindol explains with a wealth of anecdote and context, it was Patel who defined the very contours of the India we know today. This book is a must read.
- - Saradindu Mukherji, Member, Indian Council of Historical Research
Hindol writes popular, unpopular history. Another brilliant book, this time putting the untold story of one of India's greatest political leaders in front of today's readers in a way which makes it accessible and unputdownable. His work of putting together Sardar Patel's life story is strikingly accurate yet stunningly engrossing.
- Vikramjit Bannerjee, Senior Advocate, Supreme Court of India, and Advocate General of Nagaland
'This is one of those rare, great books which every Indian should read. After all, it is also about Vallabhbhai Patel, the man who created the modern state of India out of myriad fragments. Drawing upon a well-researched base of facts and writings, Sengupta emerges as a masterful storyteller who has weaved together a very coherent and absorbing story. The complex relationships among the leaders of the Indian freedom struggle are captured in all their subtle shades and colourful complexity. The end result is, for the reader, a more holistic understanding of Indian history, a much-needed filling up of certain gaps in our knowledge of the past, and a refreshingly enriched perspective on the architects of modern India'

They reveal how issues are framed and topics chosen, and contrast the double standards underlying accounts of free elections, a free press, and governmental repression between Nicaragua and El Salvador; between the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the American invasion of Vietnam; between the genocide in Cambodia under a pro-American government and genocide under Pol Pot.

Twenty years ago, Bill Bryson went on a trip around Britain to celebrate the green and kindly island that had become his adopted country. The hilarious book that resulted, Notes from a Small Island, was taken to the nation’s heart and became the bestselling travel book ever, and was also voted in a BBC poll the book that best represents Britain.Now, to mark the twentieth anniversary of that modern classic, Bryson makes a brand-new journey round Britain to see what has changed.

Following (but not too closely) a route he dubs the Bryson Line, from Bognor Regis to Cape Wrath, by way of places that many people never get to at all, Bryson sets out to rediscover the wondrously beautiful, magnificently eccentric, endearingly unique country that he thought he knew but doesn’t altogether recognize any more. Yet, despite Britain’s occasional failings and more or less eternal bewilderments, Bill Bryson is still pleased to call our rainy island home. And not just because of the cream teas, a noble history, and an extra day off at Christmas.

Gandhi: The Years That Changed the World,Ramachandra Guha,"Hardcover,– 11 Sep 2018",4.2,54.0,"Gandhi lived one of the great 20th-century lives. He inspired and enraged, challenged and delighted millions of men and women around the world. He lived almost entirely in the shadow of the British Raj, which for much of his life seemed a permanent fact, but which he did more than anyone else to bring down. In a world defined by violence and warfare and by fascist and communist dictatorships, he was armed with nothing more than his arguments and example. While fighting for national freedom, he also attacked caste and gender hierarchies, and fought (and died) for inter-religious harmony.

River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West,Rebecca Solnit,"Paperback,– 2 Mar 2004",5.0,,"Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism and the Mark Lynton History Prize

Through the story of the pioneering photographer Eadweard Muybridge, the author of Men Explain Things to Me explores what it was about California in the late 19th-century that enabled it to become such a center of technological and cultural innovation

The world as we know it today began in California in the late 1800s, and Eadweard Muybridge had a lot to do with it. This striking assertion is at the heart of Rebecca Solnit’s new book, which weaves together biography, history, and fascinating insights into art and technology to create a boldly original portrait of America on the threshold of modernity. The story of Muybridge—who in 1872 succeeded in capturing high-speed motion photographically—becomes a lens for a larger story about the acceleration and industrialization of everyday life. Solnit shows how the peculiar freedoms and opportunities of post–Civil War California led directly to the two industries—Hollywood and Silicon Valley—that have most powerfully defined contemporary society.",Cinema & Broadcast (Books),"Arts, Film & Photography",2.8153984154164347

"Wind/Pinball: Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973 (Two Novels) (Vintage International)",Haruki Murakami,"Paperback,– 3 May 2016",3.7,17.0,"Coming this October: Killing Commendatore, the much-anticipated new novel from Haruki Murakami

NATIONAL BESTSELLER

Wind/Pinball, a unique two-in-one volume, includes, on one side, Murakami’s first novel Hear the Wind Sing. When you flip the book over, you can read his second novel, Pinball, 1973. Each book has its own stunning cover.

In the spring of 1978, a young Haruki Murakami sat down at his kitchen table and began to write. The result: two remarkable short novels—Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973—that launched the career of one of the most acclaimed authors of our time.

These powerful, at times surreal, works about two young men coming of age—the unnamed narrator and his friend the Rat—are stories of loneliness, obsession, and eroticism. They bear all the hallmarks of Murakami’s later books, and form the first two-thirds, with A Wild Sheep Chase, of the trilogy of the Rat. 

Widely available in English for the first time ever, newly translated, and featuring a new introduction by Murakami himself, Wind/Pinball gives us a fascinating insight into a great writer’s beginnings.",Humour (Books),Humour,2.9132839017604186
Mid-Wicket Tales: From Trumper to Tendulkar,S Giridhar,"Paperback,– 3 Jun 2014",4.6,18.0,"A collection that certainly would fight for a place in any kind of cricket fan’s affections...the essays in the book cover the entire range of skills: bowling, batting, fielding, wicket keeping and captaincy. They question preconceived notions and stand a few clichés on their head with a lightness of touch and much finesse. The book works at several levels. For everyone who remembers an age where ‘days cricket’ of all forms was central, it is a dip into nostalgia combined with an acceptance and appreciation of the modern.
Written with the passion of a fan and knowledge of a cricketer, Mid-Wicket Tales: From Trumper to Tendulkar is for all genuine lovers of cricket from every cricketing nation. It celebrates cricket in all its hues and brings alive the rich history, romance and technical nuances of the game, where diligent research and analysis is blended with rare and interesting anecdotes.

Even as the essays reflect the authors' passion for the game, there is a perspective, balance and tolerant objectivity right through the book. Thus, if they lavish praise on Rahul Dravid for his batting or the wondrous all-round skills of Garry Sobers or the incomparable slip catching of Bobby Simpson, they also admire the less successful test cricketers, for there are just a few thousand test players in 137 years of international cricket.
It is the sort of book one can reach out and spend 30 minutes on any number of occasions, just like meeting old friends.

The Voynich Manuscript,Raymond Clemens,"Hardcover,– 1 Nov 2016",5.0,,"The first authorized copy of this mysterious, much-speculated-upon, one-of-a-kind, centuries-old puzzle. The Voynich Manuscript is produced from new photographs of the entire original and accompanied by expert essays that invite anyone to understand and explore the enigma. Many call the fifteenth-century codex, commonly known as the ""Voynich Manuscript,"" the world's most mysterious book. Written in an unknown script by an unknown author, the manuscript has no clearer purpose now than when it was rediscovered in 1912 by rare books dealer Wilfrid Voynich. The manuscript appears and disappears throughout history, from the library of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to a secret sale of books in 1903 by the Society of Jesus in Rome. The book's language has eluded decipherment, and its elaborate illustrations remain as baffling as they are beautiful. For the first time, this facsimile, complete with elaborate folding sections, allows readers to explore this enigma in all its stunning detail, from its one-of-a-kind ""Voynichese"" text to its illustrations of otherworldly plants, unfamiliar constellations, and naked women swimming though fantastical tubes and green baths. The essays that accompany the manuscript explain what we have learned about this work-from alchemical, cryptographic, forensic, and historical perspectives-but they provide few definitive answers. Instead, as New York Times best-selling author Deborah Harkness says in her introduction, the book ""invites the reader to join us at the heart of the mystery.""",European History,Humour,3.483301952358167
Hostage,Guy Delisle,"Hardcover,– 23 May 2017",4.7,7.0,"How Does One Survive When All Hope Is Lost?

In the middle of the night in 1997, Doctors Without Borders administrator Christophe André was kidnapped by armed men and taken away to an unknown destination in the Caucasus region. For three months and ré was kept handcuffed in solitary confinement, with little to survive on and almost no contact with the outside world. Close to twenty years later, award-winning cartoonist Guy Delisle ( Pyongyang, Jerusalem, Shenzhen, Burma Chronicles ) recounts André’s harrowing experience in Hostage, a book that attests to the power of one man’s determination in the face of a hopeless situation.

Marking a departure from the author’s celebrated first-person travelogues, Delisle tells the story through the perspective of the titular captive, who strives to keep his mind alert as desperation starts to set in. Working in a pared down style with muted colour washes, Delisle conveys the psychological effects of solitary confinement, compelling us to ask ourselves some difficult questions regarding the repercussions of negotiating with kidnappers and what it really means to be free. Thoughtful, intense and moving, Hostage takes a profound look at what drives our will to survive in the darkest of moments.",Literature & Fiction (Books),Comics & Mangas,2.9542425094393248
Crystallizing Public Opinion,Edward L Bernays,"Hardcover,– Import, 27 Mar 2019",4.0,2.0,"In writing this book I have tried to set down the board principles that govern the profession of public relations. It is certain that the power of public opinion is constantly increasing and will keep on increasing. It is equally certain that it is more and more being influenced, changed, stirred by impulses from below. The danger which this development contains for a progressive ennobling of human society and a progressive heightening of human culture is apparent. The duty of the higher strata of society--the cultivated, the learned, the expert, the intellectual--is therefore clear. They must inject moral and spiritual motives into public opinion. Public opinion must become public conscience.","Language, Linguistics & Writing (Books)","Language, Linguistics & Writing",2.951823035315912

This is a book that students of architecture will want to keep in the studio and in their backpacks. It is also a book they may want to keep out of view of their professors, for it expresses in clear and simple language things that tend to be murky and abstruse in the classroom. These 101 concise lessons in design, drawing, the creative process, and presentation-from the basics of ""How to Draw a Line"" to the complexities of color theory-provide a much-needed primer in architectural literacy, making concrete what too often is left nebulous or open-ended in the architecture curriculum. Each lesson utilizes a two-page format, with a brief explanation and an illustration that can range from diagrammatic to whimsical. The lesson on ""How to Draw a Line"" is illustrated by examples of good and bad lines; a lesson on the dangers of awkward floor level changes shows the television actor Dick Van Dyke in the midst of a pratfall; a discussion of the proportional differences between traditional and modern buildings features a drawing of a building split neatly in half between the two. Written by an architect and instructor who remembers well the fog of his own student days, 101 Things I Learned in Architecture School provides valuable guideposts for navigating the design studio and other classes in the architecture curriculum. Architecture graduates-from young designers to experienced practitioners-will turn to the book as well, for inspiration and a guide back to basics when solving a complex design problem.",Engineering,"Arts, Film & Photography",2.930949031167523

The Kalam Effect : My Years With The President,P M Nair,"Paperback,– 5 May 2011",4.3,33.0,"A.P.J. Abdul Kalam became President of India in July 2002. He was a surprise choice. A scientist and not a politician, with an unusual hairstyle and an unassuming way of doing things, and no other agenda except that of seeing India become a developed and strong nation. How would such a man fit into the regal splendour of Rashtrapati Bhavan, and all the pomp and ceremony of a head of state? What followed, however, as P.M. Nair shows in The Kalam Eff ect, was a remarkable presidency that in the next five years transformed the way people looked at this office, and made Kalam popular in a way few politicians have been. Rashtrapati Bhavan became a much more accessible place, and his 'at homes' drew guests in the thousands. Not only that, the website he set up became a huge draw, and people wrote to him on e-mail or otherwise from across the country. His positive attitude infected all those who came in touch with him. While the reasons for his popularity will be analysed for a long time, Nair, who was his Secretary, suggests in this affectionate yet factual account some of the probable causes. One of these being that Kalam is just a very special human being.",Biographies & Autobiographies (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.4082399653118496

"The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam",Douglas Murray,"Paperback,– 14 Jun 2018",4.1,7.0,"The Sunday Times number one bestseller - now including new material by the author, Douglas Murray
Taking into account recent global events since its first explosive publication, The Strange Death of Europe is a highly personal account of a continent and culture caught in the act of suicide. Declining birth-rates, mass immigration and cultivated self-distrust and self-hatred have come together to make Europeans unable to argue for themselves and incapable of resisting their own comprehensive change as a society. This book is not only an analysis of demographic and political realities, but also an eyewitness account of a continent in self-destruct mode. It includes reporting from across the entire continent, from the places where migrants land to the places they end up, from the people who appear to welcome them in to the places which cannot accept them.
Told from this first-hand perspective, and backed with impressive research and evidence, the book addresses the disappointing failure of multiculturalism, Angela Merkel's U-turn on migration, the lack of repatriation and the Western fixation on guilt. Murray travels to Berlin, Paris, Scandinavia, Lampedusa and Greece to uncover the malaise at the very heart of the European culture, and to hear the stories of those who have arrived in Europe from far away. In each chapter he also takes a step back to look at the bigger issues which lie behind a continent's death-wish, answering the question of why anyone, let alone an entire civilisation, would do this to themselves? He ends with two visions of Europe - one hopeful, one pessimistic - which paint a picture of Europe in crisis and offer a choice as to what, if anything, we can do next.",Political Theory (Books),Politics,2.6242820958356683

'The most affecting and successful narrative ever done about the Holocaust'
Wall Street Journal
'The first masterpiece in comic book history' The New Yorker
The Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus tells the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Jewish survivor of Hitler's Europe, and his son, a cartoonist coming to terms with his father's story. Maus approaches the unspeakable through the diminutive. Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews mice), shocks us out of any lingering sense of familiarity and succeeds in 'drawing us closer to the bleak heart of the Holocaust' (The New York Times).
Maus is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek's harrowing story of survival is woven into the author's account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. Against the backdrop of guilt brought by survival, they stage a normal life of small arguments and unhappy visits. This astonishing retelling of our century's grisliest news is a story of survival, not only of Vladek but of the children who survive even the survivors. Maus studies the bloody pawprints of history and tracks its meaning for all of us.
This combined, definitive edition includes Maus I: A Survivor's Tale and Maus II.
Art Spiegelman is a contributing editor and artist for the New Yorker. His drawings and prints have been exhibited in museums and galleries around the world.

Seventeen days of sporting competition watched and followed on every continent and in every country on the planet. Simply, the greatest show on earth. Yet when the modern games were inaugurated in Athens in 1896, the founders thought them a ""display of manly virtue"", an athletic celebration of the kind of amateur gentleman that would rule the world. How was such a ritual invented? Why did it prosper and how has it been so utterly transformed? In The Games, David Goldblatt - winner of the 2015 William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award - takes on a breathtakingly ambitious search for the answers and brilliantly unravels the complex strands of this history. Beginning with the Olympics as a sporting side show at the great Worlds Fairs of the Belle Epoque and its transformation into a global media spectacular, care of Hollywood and the Nazi party, The Games shows how sport and the Olympics had been a battlefield during the Cold War, a defining moment for social and economic change in host cities and countries, and a theatre of resistance for women and athletes of colour once excluded from the show. Illuminated with dazzling vignettes from over a century of Olympic competition - this stunningly researched history captures the excitement of sporting brilliance and the kaleidoscopic experience of the Games. It shows us how this sporting spectacle has come to reflect the world we hope to inhabit and the one we actually live in.",History (Books),Sports,2.537819095073274

Our ancestors crossed deserts, mountains, and oceans without even a whisper of what anyone today might consider modern technology. Those feats of endurance now seem impossible in an age where we take comfort for granted. But what if we could regain some of our lost evolutionary strength by simulating the environmental conditions of our ancestors?
Investigative journalist and anthropologist Scott Carney takes up the challenge to find out: Can we hack our bodies and use the environment to stimulate our inner biology? Helping him in his search for the answers is Dutch fitness guru Wim Hof, whose ability to control his body temperature in extreme cold has sparked a whirlwind of scientific study. Carney also enlists input from an Army scientist, a world-famous surfer, the founders of an obstacle course race movement, and ordinary people who have documented how they have cured autoimmune diseases, lost weight, and reversed diabetes. In the process, he chronicles his own transformational journey as he pushes his body and mind to the edge of endurance, a quest that culminates in a record-bending, 28-hour climb to the snowy peak of Mt. Kilimanjaro wearing nothing but a pair of running shorts and sneakers.
An ambitious blend of investigative reporting and participatory journalism, What Doesn’t Kill Us explores the true connection between the mind and the body and reveals the science that allows us to push past our perceived limitations.",Anthropology (Books),Sports,3.082066934285113

The story of the third great Moghul Emperor, Akbar, leader of a triumphant dynasty which contained the seeds of its own destruction.

Akbar, ruler of a sixth of the world's people, colossally rich and utterly ruthless, was a contemporary of Elizabeth I, but infinitely more powerful. His reign began in bloodshed when he strangled his treacherous 'milk-brother', but it ended in glory.

Akbar extended his rule over much of Asia, skillfully commanding tens of thousands of men, elephants and innovative technology, yet despite the unimaginable bloodshed which resulted his empire was based on universal religious tolerance.

However, Akbar's homelife was more complicated. He defied family, nobles and mullahs to marry a beautiful Rajput princess, whose people he had conquered; but she hated Akbar and turned Salim, his eldest son, against him. What's more, as any Moghul prince could inherit his father's crown and become Emperor, his sons were brought up to be intensely competitive and suspicious of each other: to see eachother as rivals for the greatest prize of all. And, as Salim grew to manhood, the relationship between father and son became tainted by rebellion and competition to be the greatest Moghul of them all.",Action & Adventure (Books),Action & Adventure,2.4800069429571505

From encouraging her to choose a helicopter, and not only a doll, as a toy if she so desires; having open conversations with her about clothes, makeup, and sexuality; debunking the myth that women are somehow biologically arranged to be in the kitchen making dinner, and that men can ""allow"" women to have full careers, Dear Ijeawele goes right to the heart of sexual politics in the twenty-first century. It will start a new and urgently needed conversation about what it really means to be a woman today.",Essays (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.303196057420489

Atlas Shrugged (Penguin Modern Classics),Ayn Rand,"Paperback,– 1 Feb 2007",3.9,154.0,"A towering philosophical novel that is the summation of her Objectivist philosophy, Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is the saga of the enigmatic John Galt, and his ambitious plan to 'stop the motor of the world', published in Penguin Modern Classics.
Opening with the enigmatic question 'Who is John Galt?', Atlas Shrugged envisions a world where the 'men of talent' - the great innovators, producers and creators - have mysteriously disappeared. With the US economy now faltering, businesswoman Dagny Taggart is struggling to get the transcontinental railroad up and running. For her John Galt is the enemy, but as she will learn, nothing in this situation is quite as it seems. Hugely influential and grand in scope, this story of a man who stopped the motor of the world expounds Rand's controversial philosophy of Objectivism, which champions competition, creativity and human greatness.
Ayn Rand (1905-82), born Alisa Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg, Russia, emigrated to America with her family in January 1926, never to return to her native land. Her novel The Fountainhead was published in 1943 and eventually became a bestseller. Still occasionally working as a screenwriter, Rand moved to New York City in 1951 and published Atlas Shrugged in 1957. Her novels espoused what came to be called Objectivism, a philosophy that champions capitalism and the pre-eminence of the individual.
If you enjoyed Atlas Shrugged, you might like Rand's The Fountainhead, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.

You'd be wrong. When he buys a beach house on the Carolina coast, Sedaris envisions long, relaxing vacations spent playing board games and lounging in the sun with those he loves most. And life at the Sea Section, as he names the vacation home, is exactly as idyllic as he imagined, except for one tiny, vexing realization: it's impossible to take a vacation from yourself.

Make no mistake: these stories are very, very funny - it's a book that can make you laugh 'til you snort, the way only family can.

For centuries, Indians have been asking all kinds of questions – about the meaning of life, our place in the cosmos, why we have so many gods and other such vital things. In the last hundred-odd years, marketing and advertising has given us none of those answers. What it has given us, nonetheless, is life-altering stuff.

It has attempted to make men Fair and Handsome. It has battled to make women 18 Again. And to both men and women it has given Tinder loving care.

It has made us realize that we like pizza as much as the next Italian – as long as Dominos puts keema dopyaaza on it and tempts us with, ‘Hungry kya?’

It has made us re-evaluate our life choices and ask thought-provoking questions like ‘Kitna deti hai?’ of our cars and ‘Kya aap Close-Up karte hain?’ of our toothpaste. In short, it has enriched our lives with quirky quips and clever (and, at times, outrageous) turns of phrase, unforgettable mascots, all-out Battles of the Brands, eye-popping insights and lump-in-the-throat moments, while feeding our addiction to controversies and virtual worlds.

"Fix Your Problems - The Tenali Raman Way: Seek Solutions To Social, Personal and Family Problems the Tenali Raman Way",Vishal Goyal,"Paperback,– 26 May 2011",4.1,10.0,"Tenali Raman was a court jester, an intelligent advisor and one of the ashtadiggajas (elephants serving as pillars and taking care of all the eight sides) in the Bhuvana Vijayam (Royal Court) of the famed Emperor of Vijayanagar Empire (City of Joy) in Karnataka – Sri Krishna Deva Raya (1509-1529), the model ruler par excellence to Ashoka, Samudra Gupta and Harsha Vardhana. Tenali Raman was an embodiment of acute wit and humour and an admirable poet of knowledge, shrewdness and ingenuity. In a short span, the legacy left behind by Tenali Raman attained eternity. All these qualities of Tenali Raman have been fully explored and displayed in this collection of vibrant fables and anecdotes. The book is a marvellous treasury of legends of Tenali Raman and Emperor Raya which evokes a long lost, never-never land: an enchanted world of alert wits and tricky gossips; crafty crooks with biting tongues, valiant brigands and an assorted cluster of uncommon common people. Narrated by the author and superbly illustrated, “Fix Your Problems–The Tenali Raman Way” is an engaging blend of earthly wisdom and sparkling humour which deal with concepts that have certain timelessness. Each story is followed by terse moral and incalculable snippets which are usually that little extra that brings the reader a little more closer to his goal on the way to realisation. Every story purveys a pithy folk wisdom that triumphs over all trials and tribulations. The moralistic traits sagaciously portrayed by these stories intend to develop a series of impacts that can reinforce certain key ideas by the rational mind of the readers in all facets of life and propel them to the top in every endeavour. The stories' various layers of meaning educates, informs, advises, enthuses, inspires and amuses and thus have a teaching effect which makes this book a must read for every aspiring individual who wants to race ahead in the world of opportunities and cusses. The book also exposes how richly endowed Bharata Khanda (India before invasions) had been in the east in the field of wisdom and knowledge down the ages of which the west is ignorant.",Society & Culture (Books),Humour,2.220108088040055

We will always be happy, he argued, if we learn to desire that things should be exactly as they are. After attaining his freedom, Epictetus spent his entire career teaching philosophy and advising a daily regimen of self-examination. His pupil Arrianus later collected and published the master's lecture notes; the Enchiridion, or Manual, is a distillation of Epictetus' teachings and an instructional manual for a tranquil life.

The Veteran,Frederick Forsyth,"Mass Market Paperback,– 2 Sep 2002",3.9,14.0,"A collection of five heart-stopping stories from the master thriller writer.

A miracle in war-torn Siena that begins with the persecution of a young nun in the turbulent days of the sixteenth century and culminates in the bitter German retreat from Italy; a drug smuggling heist on an international flight where the Knock pit their wits against the smugglers; a brural urban murder, where a brilliant QC decides to defend the killers, resulting in a startling justice; an incandescent art scam at a famous London auction house, and a brilliantly plotted revenge that shatters the elegant world of the Old Masters - each story is a remarkable tour de force.

And above all here is a brilliant novella, 'Whispering Wind', which begins with the single survivor of Custer's Last Stand at the battle of Little Big Horn.

The Brothers Karamazov (Penguin Classics),Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"Paperback,– 27 Feb 2003",4.3,35.0,"Fyodor Dostoyevsky's powerful meditation on faith, meaning and morality, The Brothers Karamazov is translated with an introduction and notes by David McDuff in Penguin Classics. When brutal landowner Fyodor Karamazov is murdered, the lives of his sons are changed irrevocably: Mitya, the sensualist, whose bitter rivalry with his father immediately places him under suspicion for parricide; Ivan, the intellectual, whose mental tortures drive him to breakdown; the spiritual Alyosha, who tries to heal the family's rifts; and the shadowy figure of their bastard half-brother Smerdyakov. As the ensuing investigation and trial reveal the true identity of the murderer, Dostoyevsky's dark masterpiece evokes a world where the lines between innocence and corruption, good and evil, blur and everyone's faith in humanity is tested. This powerful translation of The Brothers Karamazov features and introduction highlighting Dostoyevsky's recurrent themes of guilt and salvation, with a new chronology and further reading. Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky (1821-1881) was born in Moscow. From 1849-54 he lived in a convict prison, and in later years his passion for gambling led him deeply into debt. His other works available in Penguin Classics include Crime & Punishment, The Idiot and Demons. If you enjoyed The Brothers Karamazov you might like Nikolai Gogol's Dead Souls, also available in Penguin Classics.

North: Finding My Way While Running the Appalachian Trail,Scott Jurek,"Paperback,– Import, 12 Apr 2018",5.0,,"*The New York Times Bestseller*

‘Heartwrenching and spellbinding.’ Christopher McDougall, author of Born to Run

2,200 miles. 47 days. One remarkable athlete.
Scott Jurek takes on the Appalachian Trail.

Scott Jurek is one of the greatest ultramarathon runners of all time and a living legend. North tells the story of his biggest challenge, undertaken at the end of a career full of glittering achievements: breaking the speed record for the Appalachian Trail, the famous path that runs for nearly 2,200 miles between Georgia and Maine, almost the entire length of the United States.

An ordeal of torturous physical exertion, debilitating sleep deprivation and unimaginable psychological pressure, the run required Jurek to reinvent himself at an age when lesser athletes would have been winding down. Battered by the elements and nearly beaten by an agonising injury, he ran, hiked and stumbled for forty-six days, eleven hours and twenty minutes, covering nearly fifty miles every single day. Always unsure whether he was going to make it to the finish, he was pulled north in pursuit of a lifelong dream.

Filled with Jurek’s unique insights into running, as well as compelling descriptions of the awe-inspiring landscape of the Appalachian Trail and its rich history, North will delight runners and non-runners alike and will inspire anyone striving for their personal best.

Mad About Star Wars,Jonathan Bresman,"Paperback,– 28 May 2015",4.5,2.0,"A long time ago (thirty years) in a galaxy far, far away (California).
It is a period steeped in cinematic lore. Rebel filmmaker George Lucas, striking from a base in Northern California, won a tremendous box office victory against all odds with Star Wars, his sci-fi spectacular.
During the ensuing craze, MAD's ""Usual Gang of Idiots” managed to steal a few laughs at the movie's expense, soon discovering that Star Wars was the ultimate pop culture punching bag.
Pursuing each Star Wars film's release with more mockery, the MAD men spent the next three decades making a farce of the Force and spreading mirth across the galaxy.
Now, in this special edition volume, you'll chuckle as the Star Wars saga's greatest moments are mocked by such MAD greats as Dick DeBartolo, Mort Drucker, Don Martin and Sergio Aragonés, smirk as the striking similarities between the space battles created by Industrial Light & Magic and by the ""Usual Gang of Idiots” are revealed, hum along to the unforgettable Star Wars musical, as penned by MAD's master lyricist, Frank Jacobs, gasp at the startling insights into R2-D2's love life, and marvel at the real reason why Lucas's lawyers never sued MAD.
And that's just the beginning.

No Holding Back: The Autobiography,Michael Holding,"Paperback,– 14 Apr 2011",4.0,,"The autobiography of West Indies fast-bowling legend turned Sky pundit, Michael Holding.
As one of the fastest bowlers the world has seen, Michael Holding went by the haunting nickname 'Whispering Death', claiming 249 Test wickets. Despite having not laced his bowling boots since 1989, it remains a fitting sobriquet. As a commentator and administrator, Holding has delivered his views on cricket in the same manner that he played the game: he speaks softly with a rich Jamaican rhythm and is calculated in either criticism or compliment. NO HOLDING BACK charts his effortless transition from one of the great players to one of the great pundits.
Holding graphically describes his days as a player, looking back at how he tried to deliberately hurt batsmen on the wastelands of Kingston, and his first match for Jamaica when he almost collapsed from exhaustion - after only four overs! There is time, too, to divulge what it was like to tour with the West Indies, and unmissable insights about sharing a dressing room with other legends of the game like Clive Lloyd, Sir Viv Richards and Malcolm Marshall.
Holding does not shirk the big issues, as he discusses how the West Indies have slipped following their halcyon days, openly assesses Brian Lara and laments the hypocrisy over the state of the game in the region. The controversy surrounding the Allen Stanford $20m spectacle, the ICC's handling of the abandoned England v Pakistan match, player power, illegal bowling actions and the threat of Twenty20 to the Test game are all subjects which Holding tackles with characteristic knowledge and class.",Biographies & Autobiographies (Books),Sports,2.6720978579357175

Watch Andy Field's introductory video to Discovering Statistics Using R
Keeping the uniquely humorous and self-deprecating style that has made students across the world fall in love with Andy Field's books, Discovering Statistics Using R takes students on a journey of statistical discovery using R, a free, flexible and dynamically changing software tool for data analysis that is becoming increasingly popular across the social and behavioural sciences throughout the world.
The journey begins by explaining basic statistical and research concepts before a guided tour of the R software environment. Next you discover the importance of exploring and graphing data, before moving onto statistical tests that are the foundations of the rest of the book (for example correlation and regression). You will then stride confidently into intermediate level analyses such as ANOVA, before ending your journey with advanced techniques such as MANOVA and multilevel models. Although there is enough theory to help you gain the necessary conceptual understanding of what you're doing, the emphasis is on applying what you learn to playful and real-world examples that should make the experience more fun than you might expect.
Like its sister textbooks, Discovering Statistics Using R is written in an irreverent style and follows the same ground-breaking structure and pedagogical approach. The core material is augmented by a cast of characters to help the reader on their way, together with hundreds of examples, self-assessment tests to consolidate knowledge, and additional website material for those wanting to learn more.
Given this book's accessibility, fun spirit, and use of bizarre real-world research it should be essential for anyone wanting to learn about statistics using the freely-available R software.",Software & Business Applications (Books),"Computing, Internet & Digital Media",3.7204900684500517

Of Counsel: The Challenges of the Modi-Jaitley Economy,Arvind Subramanian,"Hardcover,– 5 Dec 2018",4.5,38.0,"For nearly four years, Arvind Subramanian stood at the centre of economic policymaking in India. Through the communication of big ideas and the publication of accessible Economic Surveys, he gained a reputation as an innovator. Through honest pronouncements that avoided spin, he became a figure of public trust. What does it entail to serve at the helm of the world's fastest-growing economy, where decision-making affects a population of more than a billion people?
In Of Counsel: The Challenges of the Modi-Jaitley Economy, Arvind Subramanian provides an inside account of his rollercoaster journey as the chief economic advisor to the Government of India from 2014-18, succeeding Raghuram Rajan as captain of the ship. With an illustrious cast of characters, Subramanian's part-memoir, part-analytical writings candidly reveal the numerous triumphs and challenges of policymaking at the zenith, while appraising India's economic potential, health and future through comprehensive research and original hypotheses.
Charged with the task to restructure an insecure and fragile economy, Subramanian's trusteeship has seen the country through one of the most hotly contested and turbulent periods of economic governance and policymaking in recent decades-from the controversial recall of 85 per cent of circulated currency during demonetization to a complete overhaul in taxation with the introduction of the GST. Subramanian also addresses the overleveraging of public-sector banks, the fraught links between the state and private sector ('stigmatized capitalism'), the changing relationship between the state and the individual, and the ever-pervasive, life-threatening issues surrounding climate change.
Recognized as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers according to Foreign Policy magazine, Arvind Subramanian's Of Counsel: The Challenges of the Modi-Jaitley Economy is a deep-dive into the man, the moments, the measures and the means.",Economics Textbooks,"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.6053050461411096

Mumbai, April 2012. The gruesome murder of a senior citizen in a wealthy Mumbai neighbourhood leads the city’s Crime Branch to unearth several half-naked, mutilated and dismembered bodies rotting in the ravines of the Western Ghats on the outskirts of the city.
A trail of missing suspects, a lethal honey-trap, and unexpected links with Mumbai's film industry and the underworld, brings the investigators - and the press, ever hungry for breaking news - to Vijay Palande, a cold-blooded killer equipped with the sophistication of Charles Sobhraj, the manipulative genius of Ted Bundy and the cruelty of Jack the Ripper.
In The Front Page Murders, Puja Changoiwala, who covered the incidents as they unfolded, recounts in gripping detail the story behind the sensational case of multiple murders that shocked the country. Startling and intensely sobering by turns, her compelling narrative explores not just the murky depths of a serial killer's mind but, tellingly, the media's frenzy for a juicy story and the insatiable human appetite for horror.

The author uses her bold style to write on a topic which is considered taboo by most Indian authors. The story is sensuous and exciting, fit for the modern society in which it is set.
The story of Accidentally In Love revolves around Chhavi Mukherjee. She is a model, who has managed to navigate through dark waters of the industry and secure a place for herself as a reputed model. Just when she feels that nothing could go wrong with her life, fate decides to throw a few surprises in her path. Apart from the cut-throat competition which she has to encounter on a daily basis, she comes across Tushar, a successful photographer, who sweeps her off her feet. What ensues is an erotic relationship where sparks fly. The two of them are flooded with desire at first sight. It’s a relationship that is based purely on the passion that the two souls share for each other. Chhavi does not believe in love and so a relationship with no-strings-attached suits her just fine. She believes that a relationship without commitment or plans for the future, based on just passion, is for the best.
As the story continues, Chhavi finds herself getting more and more attached to Tushar and she begins to enjoy her relationship for more than just the few moments of passion.One day, when Tushar leaves for work, Chhavi starts missing him and realises that she has grown fond of him. Find out if Chhavi is able to confront Tushar with her feelings.

Media Control: The Spectacular Achievements of Propaganda (Open Media Series),Noam Chomsky,"Paperback,– 3 Sep 2002",4.8,5.0,"Noam Chomsky’s backpocket classic on wartime propaganda and opinion control begins by asserting two models of democracy—one in which the public actively participates, and one in which the public is manipulated and controlled. According to Chomsky, ""propaganda is to democracy as the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state,"" and the mass media is the primary vehicle for delivering propaganda in the United States. From an examination of how Woodrow Wilson’s Creel Commission ""succeeded, within six months, in turning a pacifist population into a hysterical, war-mongering population,"" to Bush Sr.'s war on Iraq, Chomsky examines how the mass media and public relations industries have been used as propaganda to generate public support for going to war. Chomsky further touches on how the modern public relations industry has been influenced by Walter Lippmann’s theory of ""spectator democracy,"" in which the public is seen as a ""bewildered herd"" that needs to be directed, not empowered; and how the public relations industry in the United States focuses on ""controlling the public mind,"" and not on informing it.

The Ocean at the End of the Lane is the bestselling magical novel from Neil Gaiman, one of the most brilliant storytellers of our generation and author of the epic novel American Gods, and the much-loved Sandman series. 'Possibly Gaiman's most lyrical, scary and beautiful work yet. It's a tale of childhood for grown-ups, a fantasy rooted in the darkest corners of reality' (Independent on Sunday).

It began for our narrator forty years ago when the family lodger stole their car and committed suicide in it, stirring up ancient powers best left undisturbed. Dark creatures from beyond this world are on the loose, and it will take everything our narrator has just to stay alive: there is primal horror here, and menace unleashed - within his family and from the forces that have gathered to destroy it.
His only defence is three women, on a farm at the end of the lane. The youngest of them claims that her duckpond is an ocean. The oldest can remember the Big Bang.

Streetfight: Handbook for an Urban Revolution,"Janette Sadik-Khan, Seth Solomonow","Paperback,– 7 Mar 2017",4.7,3.0,"Like a modern-day Jane Jacobs, Janette Sadik-Khan transformed New York City's streets to make room for pedestrians, bikers, buses, and green spaces. Describing the battles she fought to enact change, Streetfight imparts wisdom and practical advice that other cities can follow to make their own streets safer and more vibrant. 

As New York City’s transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan managed the seemingly impossible and transformed the streets of one of the world’s greatest, toughest cities into dynamic spaces safe for pedestrians and bikers. Her approach was dramatic and effective: Simply painting a part of the street to make it into a plaza or bus lane not only made the street safer, but it also lessened congestion and increased foot traffic, which improved the bottom line of businesses. Real-life experience confirmed that if you know how to read the street, you can make it function better by not totally reconstructing it but by reallocating the space that’s already there.
     Breaking the street into its component parts, Streetfight demonstrates, with step-by-step visuals, how to rewrite the underlying “source code” of a street, with pointers on how to add protected bike paths, improve crosswalk space, and provide visual cues to reduce speeding. Achieving such a radical overhaul wasn’t easy, and Streetfight pulls back the curtain on the battles Sadik-Khan won to make her approach work. She includes examples of how this new way to read the streets has already made its way around the world, from pocket parks in Mexico City and Los Angeles to more pedestrian-friendly streets in Auckland and Buenos Aires, and innovative bike-lane designs and plazas in Austin, Indianapolis, and San Francisco. Many are inspired by the changes taking place in New York City and are based on the same techniques. Streetfight deconstructs, reassembles, and reinvents the street, inviting readers to see it in ways they never imagined.",Public Policy,Politics,3.0269416279590295
Of Human Bondage,W. Somerset Maugham,"Mass Market Paperback,– 2 Jan 2007",3.9,16.0,"From a tormented orphan with a clubfoot, Philip Carey grows into an impressionable young man with a voracious appetite for adventure and knowledge. His cravings take him to Paris at age eighteen to try his hand at art, then back to London to study medicine. But even so, nothing can sate his nagging hunger for experience. Then he falls obsessively in love, embarking on a disastrous relationship that will change his life forever.…

Marked by countless similarities to Maugham’s own life, his masterpiece is “not an autobiography,” as the author himself once contended, “but an autobiographical novel; fact and fiction are inexorably mingled; the emotions are my own.” And although he based Of Human Bondage on what he knew, his is an “excessively rare gift of storytelling...almost the equal of imagination itself.”*

Praise of Folly (Penguin Classics),Desiderius Erasmus,"Paperback,– 1 Mar 1994",5.0,,"Erasmus of Rotterdam (c. 1466-1536) is one of the greatest figures of the Renaissance humanist movement, which abandoned medieval pieties in favour of a rich new vision of the individual's potential. Praise of Folly, written to amuse his friend Sir Thomas More, is Erasmus's best-known work. Its dazzling mixture of fantasy and satire is narrated by a personification of Folly, dressed as a jester, who celebrates youth, pleasure, drunkenness and sexual desire, and goes on to lambast human pretensions, foibles and frailties, to mock theologians and monks and to praise the 'folly' of simple Christian piety. Erasmus's wit, wordplay and wisdom made the book an instant success, but it also attracted what may have been sales-boosting criticism. The Letter to Maarten van Dorp, which is a defence of his ideas and methods, is also included.

Rage Becomes Her,Soraya Chemaly,"Paperback,– Import, 18 Sep 2018",5.0,,"A conversation-shifting book urging 21st-century women to understand their anger, embrace its power, and use it as a tool for positive change 'How many women cry when angry because we've held it in for so long? How many discover that anger turned inward is depression? Soraya Chemaly's Rage Becomes Her will be good for women. After all, women have a lot to be angry about.' GLORIA STEINEM Women are angry, and it isn't hard to figure out why. We are underpaid, overworked, thwarted and diminished. The assertive among us are labelled bitches, while the expressive among us are considered shrill. We are told to stand down when we have an opinion and to calm down when we are fired up. And when we somehow manage to put one high heel-battered foot in front of the other despite all of this, we're asked if it would kill us to smile. We are mad as hell, and that's completely okay. Because contrary to the endless barrage of self-help rhetoric about anger management and letting go, the reality is that our rage is the most important resource we have as women, a force for creation rather than destruction, our sharpest tool against both personal and political oppression. Anger is not what gets in our way, it is our way. All we need to do is own it. This is a pitch perfect, engaging, and accessible credo written by one of today's most influential feminists. Analysing female anger as it relates to topics like self-worth, objectification, pain, care, fear, silence, and denial, Soraya illuminates how and why we repress our anger, revealing the harm that this causes, and helping us recognise the liberating power of owning our anger and marshalling it as a vital tool for positive change. Just as Quiet brought about a new embrace of introversion, Rage Becomes Her will bring about an embrace of feminine anger that will leave women feeling liberated, inspired and connected to an entire universe of women who are no longer interested in making nice.",Action & Adventure (Books),Action & Adventure,2.6434526764861874

The attackers achieved through this long-drawn siege what Al Qaeda did through the high-visibility mass-casualty attack of 11 September 2001. The response to this attack was the first instance of all three wings of the Indian armed forces coming together to fight terror. The attacks tested the mettle of India's elite counter-terrorist force, the National Security Guard, whose strike element was entirely made up of army personnel; the navy dispatched its marine commandos in the initial hours of the attack; the air force flew the NSG into the city and air-dropped them over Nariman House. Black Tornado, as the operation was called by the NSG, is the story of these men called into action in the desperate hours following the most sensational terrorist attack the country has ever seen. Sandeep Unnithan puts together a blow-by-blow account of the terrorist strike and how the siege of Mumbai was thwarted by India's security forces.",Journalism Books,"Language, Linguistics & Writing",2.4183012913197452

Evans,"Paperback,– 25 May 2006",5.0,,"The second book in his acclaimed trilogy on the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, Richard J. Evans' The Third Reich in Power: How the Nazis Won Over the Hearts and Minds of a Nation explores how Hitler turned Germany from a vibrant democracy into a one-party state.
Before Hitler seized power in 1933, Germany had been famous for its sophistication and complexity. So how was it possible for a group of ideological obsessives to re-mould it into a one-party state directed at war and race hate? How did the Nazis win over the hearts and minds of Germany's citizens, twist science, religion and culture, and transform the country's politics to achieve total dominance so quickly?
From the Nuremberg Laws to the Olympic Games, Kristallnacht to the Hitler Youth, this gripping account shows how a whole population became enmeshed in a dictatorship that was consumed by hatred and driven by war.

Meanwhile, Ali has been exiled for daring to defy his father.

Bone Marrow Nei Kung: Taoist Techniques for Rejuvenating the Blood and Bone,Mantak Chia,"Paperback,– 25 Oct 2006",4.6,2.0,"A guide to nourishing the body through bone marrow rejuvenation exercises

• Presents exercises to “regrow” bone marrow, revive the internal organs, and prevent osteoporosis

• Explains the use of bone breathing and bone compression, “hitting” to detoxify the body, and sexual energy massage and chi weight lifting to enhance the life force within

Most Westerners believe that a daily physical exercise program helps slow the aging process. Yet those whose bodies appear most physically fit on the outside often enjoy only the same life span as the average nonathletic person. It is the internal organs and glands that nourish every function of the body, and it is the bone marrow that nourishes and rejuvenates the organs and glands through the production of blood. By focusing only on the muscles without cultivating the internal organs, bones, and blood, the Western fitness regimen can ultimately exhaust the internal system.

In Bone Marrow Nei Kung Master Mantak Chia reveals the ancient mental and physical Taoist techniques used to “regrow” bone marrow, strengthen the bones, and rejuvenate the organs and glands. An advanced practice of Iron Shirt Chi Kung, Bone Marrow Nei Kung was developed as a way to attain the “steel body” coveted in the fields of Chinese medicine and martial arts. This method of absorbing energy into the bones revives the bone marrow and reverses the effects of aging through the techniques of bone breathing, bone compression, and sexual energy massage, which stimulates the hormonal production that helps prevent osteoporosis. Also included is extensive information on chi weight lifting and the practice of “hitting” to detoxify the body.",Martial Arts (Books),Sports,2.530199698203082

The Theory of Everything,Stephen Hawking,"Paperback,– Special Edition, 1 Jan 2007",4.6,653.0,"Seven lectures by the brilliant theoretical physicist have been compiled into this book to try to explain to the common man, the complex problems of mathematics and the question that has been gripped everyone all for centuries, the theory of existence.
Undeniably intelligent, witty and childlike in his explanations, the narrator describes every detail about the beginning of the universe. He describes what a theory that can state the initiation of everything would encompass.
Ideologies about the universe by Aristotle, Augustine, Hubble, Newton and Einstein have all been briefly introduced to the reader. Black holes and Big Bang has been explained in an unsophisticated manner for anyone to understand.
All these events and individual theories may be strung together to create a theory of the origin of everything and the author strongly believes that the origin might not necessarily be from a singular event. He advocates the idea of a multi-dimensional origin with a no-boundary condition to remain true to the theories of modern physics and quantum physics.
The book provides a clear view of the world through Stephen’s mind where he respectfully dismisses the belief that the Universe conforms by a supernatural and all-powerful entity.

Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat chronicles another segment of the multifarious adventures of this wild child and his faithful, but skeptical, friend. If the best cartoons compel readers to identify themselves within the funny frames, then all who enjoy Calvin and Hobbes are creative, imaginative, and ... bad, bad, bad!

Himalayan Blunder: The Curtain-Raiser to the Sino-Indian War of 1962,J. P. Dalvi,"Hardcover,– 1 Jan 2010",4.3,65.0,"Himalayan Blunder: The Angry Truth About Indias Most Crushing Military Disaster is an account of the 1962 Sino-Indian war through the narrative of Brigadier J. P. Dalvi, who fought in the war. Himalayan Blunder: The Angry Truth About Indias Most Crushing Military Disaster is Brigadier J. P. Dalvis retelling of the Sino-Indian war that took place in 1962 - a war that India lost. Dalvi fought the war as the Commander of the 7th Infantry Brigade in NEFA (North-East Frontier Agency). His account of the war is graphic and telling. He was captured by the Chinese forces and held for seven months. As a participant of the war, he was privy to all that went on at the battlefield as well as behind the scenes. Based on his firsthand experiences, he recounts the events that occurred between September 8, 1962 and October 20, 1962. As early as 1951, China silently and steadily began to work its way onto Indian soil. Even in the face of indisputable evidence, India insisted on maintaining cordial relations with the Chinese. China seemed only too happy to play along. Dalvi narrates the manner in which Indias own political leadership traitorously worked against its cause. In no uncertain terms, he holds three men responsible for Indias defeat - Jawaharlal Nehru, Krishna Menon, and General Brij Mohan Kaul. Issuing orders from Delhi, they seemed to be clueless about the situation on the battlefield. Undoubtedly, when they were rushed into battle, the Indian soldiers - underfed, ill-equipped, and unprepared as they were - never stood a chance against the powerful Chinese army. Regardless of that, the soldiers fought bravely and laid down their lives for their homeland. Dalvi claims that the apathy and the sheer ineptitude of those at the helm of Indias political affairs sacrificed hundreds of valuable lives. Brigadier Dalvis detailed narrative of the massacre of the Indian soldiers, a horror that he witnessed firsthand, is heart-rending. The book was published in 1969. Among all the books based on the subject of the 1962 Sino-Indian war, this book is considered to be one the most striking and authentic versions. Due to its sensitive subject matter and its portrayal of Indias leaders in a harshly negative light, the book was banned by the Indian Government upon its release. This particular edition is a 2010 reprint by Natraj Publishers. The book has been translated into Kannada by Ravi Belagere.",History (Books),Politics,2.842609239610562

As he would later write in the first of a series of deeply moving Vanity Fair pieces, he was being deported 'from the country of the well across the stark frontier that marks off the land of malady.' Over the next year he underwent the brutal gamut of modern cancer treatment, enduring catastrophic levels of suffering and eventually losing the ability to speak. Mortality is the most meditative collection of writing Hitchens has ever produced; at once an unsparingly honest account of the ravages of his disease, an examination of cancer etiquette, and the coda to a lifetime of fierce debate and peerless prose.

Do you think you’re funny? Do you want to turn your sense of humor into a career? If the answer is yes, then Judy Carter’s The Comedy Bible is for you. The guru to aspiring stand-up comics provides the complete scoop on being—and writing—funny for money.

If you’ve got a sense of humor, you can learn to make a career out of comedy, says Judy Carter. Whether it’s creating a killer stand-up act, writing a spec sitcom, or providing jokes for radio or one-liners for greeting cards, Carter provides step-by-step instructions in The Comedy Bible.

Head First SQL,Beighley Lynn,"Paperback,– 2007",4.1,23.0,"Head First SQL is ideally meant for somebody who wants an introduction to SQL. What really makes it an interesting read is the usage of geek humour thoroughly infused in the book. Funny photo captions, amusing exercises, and wordplay and make the idea of teaching something as dry as IT content very enjoyable and blatantly entertaining.
Similar to the lines of the earlier Head First series books, as a reader, one would be put to a different experience for a beginner level technical book. A lot of visuals and graphics have been used to explain topics. For example, to explain how a select statement works, the author hits you with building a dating service to illustrate the points. In order to explain the difference between sub-selects and outer joins, the author drags them out to a symbolic stage and debates over the righteousness of usage. All these elements and outlandish scenarios only make it easier for the reader to remember the information.
The book is ideally meant for somebody who is beginning to learn SQL and also has a chapter explaining the benefits of using a database at the first place. The topics mostly stick to generic SQL commonalities like selects, alter tables, joins, updates, aggregate functions, deletes, ordering, where-clauses, sub-selects, etc. Constraints, views, and some elementary security alarms are touched on, but not in great depths.
The appendices are really a collection of obscure topics that the author calls ‘left-overs’. Also, there is a quick section on PHP, GUI tools for database, a list of reticent words and some additional knowhow on data types. The first edition of Head First SQL was published by Shroff/O'Reilly in 2007 and is available in paperback.

What Happened to Governance in Kashmir?,Aijaz Ashraf Wani,"Hardcover,– 10 Jan 2019",5.0,2.0,"What Happened to Governance in Kashmir? examines the policies, strategies, and tactics followed by the Indian state and the ‘client’ governments in Srinagar to manage the conflicted state of Jammu and Kashmir during 1948–89 . It shows how the policies deployed to ‘create order in disorder’ functioned inversely and turned Kashmir into a smoldering volcano which erupted in 1989–90.
The author argues that as the issue of dispute and policy framework has been constant, the clash between the status quoist state and the society was inevitable. The crisis deepened along with technological, economic, cultural, and social changes. Based on a variety of contemporary sources, this book deals with many aspects of Kashmir’s governance through different political phases. It shows how the personal proclivities and decisions of each prime minister/chief minister played a role in determining the pattern of rule and the course of history with consequences felt many miles downstream.",Government (Books),Politics,2.938519725176492

"Eats, Shoots and Leaves",Lynne Truss,"Paperback,– 18 Feb 2010",4.1,30.0,"Punctuations are crucial to achieving proper sentence structure and flow. In contemporary times, due to the widespread use of colloquial language, punctuation marks in sentences have been given lesser and lesser importance. Eats, Shoots & Leaves is a book that attempts to present this issue of dwindling punctuation usage in a concise and humorous format. Written by popular radio show host and author Lynne Truss, this book bemoans the lack of proper grammar in present writing at large.
The author, in her book, dedicates chapters to various devices of punctuation in grammar. She dedicates entire chapters to apostrophes as well as commas, which are vital links in the chain of good punctuation. Chapters on semicolons, colons, exclamation marks, quotation marks, and question marks are provided as well in Eats, Shoots & Leaves.
Lynne Truss discusses the history of punctuations with the help of interesting anecdotes that help in engaging the readers attention. She talks about the impairing effects of internet language use, in terms of how important rules for writing have come to be disregarded. Additionally, chapters on hyphens, ellipses, brackets, emoticons, and dashes have been included as in this intriguing book.
The title of this book is based on syntactic ambiguity, which means that the meaning can be interpreted in more than one way.

The Rust Programming Language (Manga Guide),Steve Klabnik,"Paperback,– 26 Jun 2018",5.0,2.0,"The Rust Programming Language is the official book on Rust, an open-source, community-developed systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. This is the undisputed go-to guide to Rust, written by two members of the Rust core team, with feedback and contributions from 42 members of the community. The book assumes that you’ve written code in another programming language but makes no assumptions about which one, meaning the material is accessible and useful to developers from a wide variety of programming backgrounds.
 
Known by the Rust community as “The Book,” The Rust Programming Language includes concept chapters, where you’ll learn about a particular aspect of Rust, and project chapters, where you’ll apply what you’ve learned so far to build small programs. 
 
The Book opens with a quick hands-on project to introduce the basics then explores key concepts in depth, such as ownership, the type system, error handling, and fearless concurrency. Next come detailed explanations of Rust-oriented perspectives on topics like pattern matching, iterators, and smart pointers, with concrete examples and exercises--taking you from theory to practice.
 
The Rust Programming Language will also show you how to:
- Grasp important concepts unique to Rust, like ownership, borrowing, and
  lifetimes
- Use Cargo, Rust’s built-in package manager, to build and maintain your code,
  including downloading and building dependencies
- Effectively use Rust’s zero-cost abstractions and employ your own
 
You’ll learn to develop reliable code that’s speed and memory efficient, while avoiding the infamous and arcane programming pitfalls common at the systems level. When you need to dive down into lower-level control, this guide will show you how without taking on the customary risk of crashes or security holes and without requiring you to learn the fine points of a fickle toolchain.
 
You’ll also learn how to create command line programs, build single- and multithreaded web servers, and much more.
 
The Rust Programming Language fully embraces Rust’s potential to empower its users. This friendly and approachable guide will help you build not only your knowledge of Rust but also your ability to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains.",Introductory & Beginning Programming,"Computing, Internet & Digital Media",3.325515663363148

Learn Chinese Through English,Dr. Anita Sharma,"Paperback,– 1 Apr 2019",3.8,9.0,"(Learn Chinese Through English) is intended to be an intensive course book for beginners who have just started learning Chinese. This book lays emphasis on improving the ability of the learner to use Chinese for conversation. In recent years, the opportunities for business and educational trips to China have increased rapidly. Without some knowledge of the Chinese language, however, you will be either confined to your hotels and offices where English is spoken or totally dependent on the sevices of an interpreter.
This book provides you the sentence pattern you will most often need and the vocabulary with which you can create new sentences. I have used not only easy-to-understand language, but also simple grammar. By recognizing the grammatical patterns each time they reappear, you will soon be able to use them on your own.
In all the chapters, the English sentence is followed by its pronunciation in Chinese, known as pinyin which is the official transliteration of Chinese characters. This is followed by Chinese characters, known as Hanzi. The Hanzi used in this book are the simplified characters of China. Meaning of each Chinese character is given under it in English. If you have difficulty in pronouncing a Chinese word or phrase, you can point to the accompanying Hanzi and ask the Chinese with whom you wish to communicate to read it.
In pinyin, I have given tones as they are listed in. the dictionary. In the introduction, I have explained how tone of some words depend on the tone of the word following; so while speaking Chinese, do keep in mind this change in tones.
The key to learning a new language is repetition. Begin by practising a few simple phrases and then carry on with difficult ones. -, I am very grateful to Mr. Wushan whose expertise in writinq pinyin was a great help to me.

"It's Not About the Burqa: Muslim Women on Faith, Feminism, Sexuality and Race",Mariam Khan,"Paperback,– 12 Mar 2019",4.7,4.0,"When was the last time you heard a Muslim woman speak for herself without a filter? It’s Not About the Burqa started life when Mariam Khan read about the conversation in which David Cameron linked the radicalization of Muslim men to the ‘traditional submissiveness’ of Muslim women. Mariam felt pretty sure she didn’t know a single Muslim woman who would describe herself that way. Why was she hearing about Muslim women from people who were demonstrably neither Muslim nor female? Taking one of the most politicized and misused words associated with Muslim women and Islamophobia, It’s Not About the Burqa has something to say: twenty Muslim women speaking up for themselves. Here are essays about the hijab and wavering faith, about love and divorce, about queer identity, about sex, about the twin threats of a disapproving community and a racist country, and about how Islam and feminism go hand in hand. Funny, warm, sometimes sad, and often angry, each of these essays is a passionate declaration, and each essay is calling time on the oppression, the lazy stereotyping, the misogyny and the Islamophobia. It’s Not About the Burqa doesn’t claim to speak for a faith or a group of people, because it’s time the world realized that Muslim women are not a monolith. It’s time the world listened to them.",Essays (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.7420806724102023

"The Third Industrial Revolution: How Lateral Power Is Transforming Energy, the Economy, and the World",Jeremy Rifkin,"Paperback,– 8 Jan 2013",3.1,2.0,"The Industrial Revolution, powered by oil and other fossil fuels, is spiraling into a dangerous endgame. The price of gas and food are climbing, unemployment remains high, the housing market has tanked, consumer and government debt is soaring, and the recovery is slowing. Facing the prospect of a second collapse of the global economy, humanity is desperate for a sustainable economic game plan to take us into the future.
Here, Jeremy Rifkin explores how Internet technology and renewable energy are merging to create a powerful ""Third Industrial Revolution."" He asks us to imagine hundreds of millions of people producing their own green energy in their homes, offices, and factories, and sharing it with each other in an ""energy internet,"" just like we now create and share information online.
Rifkin describes how the five-pillars of the Third Industrial Revolution will create thousands of businesses, millions of jobs, and usher in a fundamental reordering of human relationships, from hierarchical to lateral power, that will impact the way we conduct commerce, govern society, educate our children, and engage in civic life.
Rifkin's vision is already gaining traction in the international community. The European Union Parliament has issued a formal declaration calling for its implementation, and other nations in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, are quickly preparing their own initiatives for transitioning into the new economic paradigm.
The Third Industrial Revolution is an insider's account of the next great economic era, including a look into the personalities and players ― heads of state, global CEOs, social entrepreneurs, and NGOs ― who are pioneering its implementation around the world.",Environmental Economics,Politics,3.004751155591001

A Life in Parts,Bryan Cranston,"Paperback,– 8 Aug 2017",5.0,6.0,"“Nothing short of riveting...an engrossing first-person account by one of our finest actors” (Huffington Post)—both a coming-of-age story and a meditation on creativity, devotion, and craft—Bryan Cranston, beloved and acclaimed star of one of history’s most successful TV shows, Breaking Bad.

Bryan Cranston began his acting career at the age of seven, when his father, a struggling actor and sometime director, cast him in a commercial for United Way. By fifth grade he was starring in the school play, spending hours at the local movie theater, and re-enacting favorite scenes with his brother in their living room. Cranston seemed destined to be an actor. But then his father left. And his family fell apart. Troubled by his father’s missteps, Cranston abandoned his acting aspirations and resolved to pursue a steadier career in law enforcement. Then, on a two-year cross-country motorcycle journey, Cranston re-discovered his talent for acting and found his mission and his calling.

In this “must-read memoir” (The Philadelphia Inquirer), Cranston traces the many roles he inhabited throughout his remarkable life, both on and off screen. For the first time he shares the story of his early years as an actor on the soap opera Loving, his recurring spots on Seinfeld, and his time as bumbling father Hal on Malcolm in the Middle, to his tour-de-force, Tony-winning performance as Lyndon Baines Johnson in Broadway’s All the Way, to his most iconic role of all: Breaking Bad’s Walter White.

“An illuminating window into the actor’s psyche” (People), Cranston has much to say about creativity, devotion, and craft, as well as innate talent and its challenges and benefits and proper maintenance. “By turns gritty, funny, and sad” (Entertainment Weekly), ultimately A Life in Parts is a story about the joy, the necessity, and the transformative power of simple hard work.",Cinema & Broadcast (Books),Humour,2.984077033902831

The Photographer's Eye Remastered 10th Anniversary: Composition and Design for Better Digital Photographs,Michael Freeman,"Paperback,– 15 Jun 2017",3.6,6.0,"With a completely refreshed look to celebrate its tenth anniversary, Michael Freeman's iconic bestseller, The Photographer's Eye, has never looked better.
Design is the single most important factor in creating a successful photograph. The ability to see the potential for a strong picture and then organize the graphic elements into an effective, compelling composition has always been one of the key skills in making photographs.
Of course, digital photography has brought a new, exciting aspect to design first because the instant feedback from a digital camera allows immediate appraisal and improvement; and second because image-editing tools make it possible to alter and enhance the design after the shutter has been pressed. This has had a profound effect on the way digital photographers take pictures.

The Photographers Eye shows how anyone can develop an eye for seeing great digital photos. The book explores all the traditional approaches to composition and design, but crucially, it also addresses the new digital technique of shooting in the knowledge that a picture will later be edited, manipulated, or montaged to result in a final image that may be very different from the one seen in the viewfinder.",Photography Textbooks,"Computing, Internet & Digital Media",3.024895960107485

A Short History of Nearly Everything,Bill Bryson,"Paperback,– 14 Sep 2004",4.6,156.0,"One of the world’s most beloved writers and bestselling author of One Summer takes his ultimate journey—into the most intriguing and intractable questions that science seeks to answer.

In A Walk in the Woods, Bill Bryson trekked the Appalachian Trail—well, most of it. In A Sunburned Country, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand—and, if possible, answer—the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it.

A world at stake. A quest for the ultimate prize. Are you ready?

It's the year 2044, and the real world has become an ugly place. We're out of oil. We've wrecked the climate. Famine, poverty, and disease are widespread.

Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes this depressing reality by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia where you can be anything you want to be, where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. And like most of humanity, Wade is obsessed by the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this alternate reality: OASIS founder James Halliday, who dies with no heir, has promised that control of the OASIS - and his massive fortune - will go to the person who can solve the riddles he has left scattered throughout his creation.

For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that the riddles are based in the culture of the late twentieth century. And then Wade stumbles onto the key to the first puzzle.

Suddenly, he finds himself pitted against thousands of competitors in a desperate race to claim the ultimate prize, a chase that soon takes on terrifying real-world dimensions - and that will leave both Wade and his world profoundly changed.

Expert Card Technique (Dover Magic Books),Jean Hugard,"Paperback,– 1 Jun 1974",4.4,12.0,"If you have ever tried to do a card trick and failed, you know what it is to be embarrassed. You may try to cover up by doing a more difficult trick and fail again. The way out of this dilemma, however, is not immediate, but it is reliable: a surer mastery of technique. This means the proper instruction book, and practice.
In this definitive work on card technique, step-by-step instructions teach you the correct methods for the basic manipulations and the more advanced flourishes, and only then allow you to learn tricks. Offering the most foolproof methods available, Jean Hugard and Fredrick Braue explain such basic manipulations as the palm, the shuffle, the lift, the side slip, the pass, the glimpse, the jog, and the reverse. They detail various false deals, crimps, and changes and the more advanced execution needed for forces, fans, and the use of the prearranged deck. Also presented is a wide variety of tricks, including discoveries, self-working tricks, one-handed tricks, stranger cards, and such individually famous tricks as the four aces, the rising cards, and the Zingone spread. In addition, the authors include a complete compendium of shakedown sleights — to warn the card player and aid the entertainer — and a performer's guide to misdirection and patter.
Many of the methods explained were revealed here for the first time, while many previously known tricks are presented in improved versions. In every case the aim is simplicity of technique for the purpose of mystifying an audience, not technique for the sake of technique. An unsurpassed collection of methods and manipulations, this classic work will help any aspiring magician to achieve expert card technique.",Games & Quizzes (Books),"Arts, Film & Photography",2.8195439355418688

Grundrisse: (Penguin Classics),Karl Marx,"Paperback,– 29 Apr 1993",4.5,2.0,"Written during the winter of 1857-8, the Grundrisse was considered by Marx to be the first scientific elaboration of communist theory. A collection of seven notebooks on capital and money, it both develops the arguments outlined in the Communist Manifesto (1848) and explores the themes and theses that were to dominate his great later work Capital. Here, for the first time, Marx set out his own version of Hegel's dialectics and developed his mature views on labour, surplus value and profit, offering many fresh insights into alienation, automation and the dangers of capitalist society. Yet while the theories in Grundrisse make it a vital precursor to Capital, it also provides invaluable descriptions of Marx's wider-ranging philosophy, making it a unique insight into his beliefs and hopes for the foundation of a communist state.

Growing up in Germany's Turkish community, he faced prejudice from those who claimed his dual identity would prevent him giving his all for the national team. Later came questions over a different type of commitment, the kind levelled against those, like Mesut Ozil, who excel in football's finer arts rather than relying simply on running and ruggedness. He has proved concerns on both these issues lack substance.
In Gunning for Greatness, Mesut Ozil reveals the inside stories of his relationships with Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger, his quest to help the under-fire Frenchman restore Arsenal's pre-eminence - and how he silenced the sceptics by conquering the world.",Biographies & Autobiographies (Books),Sports,3.5883837683787276

Big Mind – How Collective Intelligence Can Change Our World,Geoff Mulgan,"Hardcover,– Import, 27 Oct 2017",5.0,,"A new field of collective intelligence has emerged in the last few years, prompted by a wave of digital technologies that make it possible for organizations and societies to think at large scale. This ""bigger mind""--human and machine capabilities working together--has the potential to solve the great challenges of our time. So why do smart technologies not automatically lead to smart results? Gathering insights from diverse fields, including philosophy, computer science, and biology, Big Mind reveals how collective intelligence can guide corporations, governments, universities, and societies to make the most of human brains and digital technologies. Geoff Mulgan explores how collective intelligence has to be consciously organized and orchestrated in order to harness its powers. He looks at recent experiments mobilizing millions of people to solve problems, and at groundbreaking technology like Google Maps and Dove satellites. He also considers why organizations full of smart people and machines can make foolish mistakes--from investment banks losing billions to intelligence agencies misjudging geopolitical events--and shows how to avoid them. Highlighting differences between environments that stimulate intelligence and those that blunt it, Mulgan shows how human and machine intelligence could solve challenges in business, climate change, democracy, and public health. But for that to happen we'll need radically new professions, institutions, and ways of thinking. Informed by the latest work on data, web platforms, and artificial intelligence, Big Mind shows how collective intelligence could help us survive and thrive.",Economics Textbooks,"Computing, Internet & Digital Media",3.2116544005531824

Everyday life in contemporary rural India is characterized by an increased sense of mobility, inequality and uncertainty. Ordinary villagers often find themselves caught between the promises and failures of democracy and development. This ethnographic study of the village of Khanpur (in Uttar Pradesh, north India) is an attempt to grasp everyday life in rural India. Drawing on descriptions of village life, interspersed with theoretical analyses, the author examines how ordinary people construct their own sense of their lives and their futures in everyday activities: working on farms, attending college, searching for non-farm employment, celebrating religious rituals and dealing with local elections and democracy. The villagers confront growing economic and moral uncertainty; they creatively harmonize public discourse and local practice; and sometimes they resolve incoherence and unease through the use of irony. In so doing, they perform everyday village and caste ethics and re-create transient political, economic and moral communities at a time of massive social dislocation. Satendra Kumar in this lucid book shows, in no uncertain terms, that villages in Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere have been and continue to be vibrant grounds for the production of culture, sociality, hope, politics and persons. He also addresses anthropology's forfeiture of the village as a subject of study in an era of globalization.",Government (Books),Politics,2.4183012913197452

American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company,Bryce G. Hoffman,"Paperback,– 5 Feb 2013",4.5,19.0,"The inside story of the epic turnaround of Ford Motor Company under the leadership of CEO Alan Mulally.
 
At the end of 2008, Ford Motor Company was just months away from running out of cash. With the auto industry careening toward ruin, Congress offered all three Detroit automakers a bailout. General Motors and Chrysler grabbed the taxpayer lifeline, but Ford decided to save itself.

Under the leadership of charismatic CEO Alan Mulally, Ford had already put together a bold plan to unify its divided global operations, transform its lackluster product lineup, and overcome a dys­functional culture of infighting, backstabbing, and excuses. It was an extraordinary risk, but it was the only way the Ford family—America’s last great industrial dynasty—could hold on to their company.
 
Mulally and his team pulled off one of the great­est comebacks in business history. As the rest of Detroit collapsed, Ford went from the brink of bankruptcy to being the most profitable automaker in the world. American Icon is the compelling, behind-the-scenes account of that epic turnaround.

In one of the great management narratives of our time, Hoffman puts the reader inside the boardroom as Mulally uses his celebrated Business Plan Review meet­ings to drive change and force Ford to deal with the painful realities of the American auto industry.
 
Hoffman was granted unprecedented access to Ford’s top executives and top-secret company documents.

Kate Chopin was enjoying wide popularity as a writer, mainly of short stories, when her second novel, The Awakening, was published to widespread criticism of its immorality. A wake-up call to women all over the country, this landmark novel of early American feminism tells of a Louisiana wife who discovers the strength of her own sexuality and tries to wrench it from the hands of a patriarchal society. And just as Edna Pontellier is ostracized for trying to master her own sexual fate, so did Chopin’s reputation suffer after she wrote this book. Today The Awakening is considered a masterpiece and, along with Chopin’s short stories, has set a standard for younger generations of women who have learned to value their independence and authenticity.

Portrait Of A Director:satyajit Ray,Marie Seton,"Paperback,– 19 Jun 2003",4.8,10.0,"The definitive study of the life and work of India s greatest filmmaker Satyajit Ray was India s first filmmaker to gain international recognition as a master of the medium, and today he continues to be regarded as one of the world s finest directors of all time. His first film Pather Panchali, made when he was in his thirties, catapulted him into the forefront of young directors worldwide when in 1956 the Cannes Film Festival honoured it as the best human document of the year. Several other films by Ray, like Aparajito, Jalsaghar, Charulata, Nayak, Aranyer Din Ratri, Shatranj Ke Khilari, Ghare Baire and Agantuk, made over a career spanning five decades, are considered classics of contemporary cinema. In 1992, Ray was awarded the Oscar for Lifetime Achievement by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Science and, in the same year, was also honoured with the Bharat Ratna. First compared with Robert Flaherty for his lyrical use of nature and locations, Ray is now regarded as one of the great neo-realist directors. From the beginning he rejected the established path of Indian film production, declaring at the age of six: I ll go to Germany and come back and make films. He absorbed a remarkably broad culture from his family which had interesting literary, artistic and musical inclinations. With his extraordinary persistence and capacity for work, he simultaneously equipped himself with such thoroughness that he was able to create a masterpiece in his very first film. Marie Seton s classic study of Ray, the product of thorough research and a long and close association with the Ray family, is the most detailed examination available of Ray s work as musician, scenarist and director. First published in 1971, it was last updated in 1978, some fourteen years before Ray passed away. This new and revised edition includes unpublished pieces from the author s further writings on Ray, and an Afterword that takes the story forward to Ray s last film. It will, hopefully, re-introduce the genius of Ray to a whole new generation of readers and film aficionados.",Biographies & Autobiographies (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.568201724066995

Animation is one of the hottest areas of filmmaking today--and the master animator who bridges the old generation and the new is Richard Williams. During his fifty years in the business, Williams has been one of the true innovators, winning three Academy Awards and serving as the link between Disney's golden age of animation by hand and the new computer animation exemplified by Toy Story.

In this book, based on his sold-out master classes in the United States and across Europe, Williams provides the underlying principles of animation that every animator--from beginner to expert, classic animator to computer animation whiz --needs.

The Paradoxical Prime Minister,Shashi Tharoor,"Hardcover,– 26 Oct 2018",2.7,280.0,"Narendra Modi is a paradoxical man. He says one thing and does another. He gives voice to a number of liberal ideas (such as the constitution being his holy book and sab ka saath, sab ka vikas), while at the same time pandering to some of the most illiberal elements in Indian society, on whom he depends for political support.

A third paradox is his talk of soaring ambitions for the country when his government’s performance is underwhelming. So who is the real Narendra Modi? A noble, selfless leader who acts effectively in the interests of all his countrymen or an autocratic, right-wing bigot who is interested only in power and converting plural India into a Hindu Rashtra? Or something in between? This brilliant study of Modi and the effect he has had on our country answers these and other questions about a leader who is reviled and worshipped in equal measure. The book is divided into five sections comprising fifty chapters. The first section takes a close look at Modi’s life and times. The other four sections look at key aspects of the way in which Modi’s government functions and the lasting and often deleterious impact it has had on Indian society, major institutions, the economy, foreign policy and our fundamental values. Using years of close observation, personal encounters with Modi, considerable scholarship, a deep understanding of Indian politics and an insider’s view of the way in which government functions. Shashi Tharoor has stitched together a compelling portrait of this paradoxical figure. Never before has there been such a superbly written and devastatingly accurate account of the most controversial prime minister India has ever had.",Political Ideologies (Books),Politics,2.663700925389648

The Great Indian Conspiracy,Dr. Praveen Tiwari,"Paperback,– 18 Mar 2019",4.8,6.0,"Saffron terrorism.
Is it a fact? Or, is this a myth? After all, do we know enough?
The shocking blasts of Malegaon and Samjhauta were projected as 'saffron terrorism'. A new theory, terrorist attacks were tainted as such till, a few years later, Kasab's confession offered solid proof of Pakistan's role in the 26/11 attacks. Though the police had concluded a Pakistani hand for the earlier blasts, it was saffron terrorism which prevented the perpetrators of these attacks from being brought to justice.
As a theory, saffron terrorism is not just hurting Hindus sentiments but is also an obstacle to fight real terrorism sponsored by Pakistan and Islamic states. The term was coined by the erstwhile UPA government to garner minority votes and manipulate the vote bank. After all, why were the Malegaon-accused SIMI activists let off? Why did certain politicians declare not to oppose their bail? What was truly behind Aseemanand's confession? The reliability of these confessions was questionable given the police brutality that the National Investigative Agency exposed.
Journalist Praveen Tiwari explores saffron terrorism and reveals through exclusive interviews of senior National Investigative Agency officials, undercover agents and politicians how vote bank politics can compromise ethics and national security. Should the real masterminds behind the blasts be allowed to go scot-free? Should the manipulators of the Samjhauta Express bombings not be held accountable? Should we not investigate those who had exonerated Pakistan of its guilt? An extensive research on communal politics, the book offers indisputable evidence of the 'saffron terrorism' theory as the Great Indian Conspiracy.",Action & Adventure (Books),Action & Adventure,2.509202522331103

Looking for the Nation: Towards Another Idea of India,Manash Firaq Bhattacharjee,"Paperback,– 10 Aug 2018",5.0,,"‘This splendid book will deepen the understanding of nationalism in our dark time.’—Talal Asad, Distinguished Professor of Anthropology, City University of New York

This urgent and compelling book comes at a time when toxic nationalism is causing the violent and systematic exclusion of political, religious, sexual and other minorities. Manash Firaq Bhattacharjee reminds us that the modern nation-state, built on fear and an obsession with territory, is often at odds with democracy, justice and fraternity.

Critically analyzing the ideas of thinkers who laid the political and ethical grounds of India’s modern identity—Nehru, Ambedkar, Gandhi, Tagore, and Aurobindo—Bhattacharjee shows how we have strayed from their inclusive, diverse visions. He effortlessly weaves personal and intellectual histories, navigating through vast swathes of scholarship, to sketch a radically ethical imagination against the sound and fury of nationalism. He dips into fascinating anecdotes, recalling Ashok Kumar’s friendship with Manto against the shadow of Partition, Ali Sardar Jafri’s Jnanpith Award acceptance speech, and his own encounter with the Sufi qawwal, Fareed Ayaz, among others. Concluding with an enlightening genealogy of modern politics in the light of its present crisis, he exhorts us towards a new politics of trust.

In eighteenth-century France there lived a man who was one of the most gifted and abominable personages in an era that knew no lack of gifted and abominable personages. His name was Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, and if his name has been forgotten today, it is certainly not because Grenouille fell short of those more famous blackguards when it came to arrogance, misanthropy, immorality, or, more succinctly, wickedness, but because his gifts and his sole ambition were restricted to a domain that leaves no traces in history: to the fleeting realm of scent . . .

They were often mocked as the vanaras, the monkey men. Sandwiched between the never-ending war between the Deva tribes in the north and the Asura tribes in the south, the Vana Naras seemed to have lost all hope. But Baali was determined not to die a slave. Aided by his beloved brother, Sugreeva, Baali built a country for his people. The capital city, Kishkindha, became a beacon of hope for emancipated slaves from across the world. It was a city of the people, by the people, for the people, where there was no discrimination based on caste, creed, language or the colour of skin. For a brief period in history, it seemed as if mankind had found its ideal hero in Baali. But then fate intervened through the beautiful Tara, the daughter of a tribal physician. Loved by Baali and lusted after by Sugreeva, Tara became the cause of a fraternal war that would change history for ever.
The love triangle between Baali, Tara and Sugreeva is arguably the world's first.

But How Do It Know?: The Basic Principles of Computers for Everyone,J. Clark Scott,"Paperback,– 15 Mar 2011",4.7,15.0,"Finally, this brand new book exposes the secrets of computers for everyone to see. Its humorous title begins with the punch line of a classic joke about someone who is baffled by technology. It was written by a 40-year computer veteran who wants to take the mystery out of computers and allow everyone to gain a true understanding of exactly what computers are, and also what they are not. Years of writing, diagramming, piloting and editing have culminated in one easy to read volume that contains all of the basic principles of computers written so that everyone can understand them. There used to be only two types of book that delved into the insides of computers. The simple ones point out the major parts and describe their functions in broad general terms. Computer Science textbooks eventually tell the whole story, but along the way, they include every detail that an engineer could conceivably ever need to know. Like Baby Bear's porridge, But How Do It Know? is just right, but it is much more than just a happy medium. For the first time, this book thoroughly demonstrates each of the basic principles that have been used in every computer ever built, while at the same time showing the integral role that codes play in everything that computers are able to do. It cuts through all of the electronics and mathematics, and gets right to practical matters. Here is a simple part, see what it does. Connect a few of these together and you get a new part that does another simple thing. After just a few iterations of connecting up simple parts - voilà! - it's a computer. And it is much simpler than anyone ever imagined. But How Do It Know? really explains how computers work. They are far simpler than anyone has ever permitted you to believe. It contains everything you need to know, and nothing you don't need to know. No technical background of any kind is required. The basic principles of computers have not changed one iota since they were invented in the mid 20th century. ""Since the day I learned how computers work, it always felt like I knew a giant secret, but couldn't tell anyone,"" says the author. Now he's taken the time to explain it in such a manner that anyone can have that same moment of enlightenment and thereafter see computers in an entirely new light.",Computer Science Books,"Computing, Internet & Digital Media",3.1522883443830567

In Zeus Grants Stupid Wishes, Cory O’Brien, creator of Myths RETOLD!, sets the stories straight.

Odin got construction discounts with bestiality.

Isis had bad taste in jewelry.

Ganesh was the very definition of an unplanned pregnancy.

Still skeptical? Here are a few more gems to consider:

• Zeus once stuffed an unborn fetus inside his thigh to save its life after he exploded its mother by being too good in bed.

• The entire Egyptian universe was saved because Sekhmet just got too hammered to keep murdering everyone.

• The Hindu universe is run by a married couple who only stop murdering in order to throw sweet dance parties…on the corpses of their enemies.

Tom, who keeps meticulous records and whose moral principles have withstood a horrific war, wants to report the man and infant immediately. But Isabel insists the baby is a “gift from God,” and against Tom’s judgment, they claim her as their own and name her Lucy.

How To Eat: Vintage Classics Anniversary Edition,Nigella Lawson,"Paperback,– Import, 4 Oct 2018",4.5,2.0,"'At its heart, a deeply practical yet joyously readable book…you are all set to head off to the kitchen and have a truly glorious time’ Nigel Slater, Guardian


Celebrating the 20th anniversary of How to Eat: Revisit and discover the sensational debut cookbook from Nigella Lawson.

WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY JEANETTE WINTERSON

When Nigella Lawson’s first book, How to Eat, was published in 1998, two things were immediately clear: that this fresh and fiercely intelligent voice would revolutionise cookery writing, and that How to Eat was an instant classic of the genre.

Here was a versatile culinary bible, through which a generation discovered how to feel at home in the kitchen and found the confidence to experiment and adapt recipes to their own needs. This was the book to reach for when hastily organising a last-minute supper with friends, when planning a luxurious weekend lunch or contemplating a store-cupboard meal for one, or when trying to tempt a fussy toddler. This was a book about home cooking for busy lives.

The chief revelation was the writing. Rather than a set of intimidating instructions, Nigella’s recipes provide inspiration. She has a gift for finding the right word to spark the reader’s imagination, evoking the taste of the ingredients, the simple, sensual pleasures of the practical process, the deep reward of the finished dish. Passionate, trenchant, convivial and wise, Nigella’s prose demands to be savoured, and ensures that the joy and value of How to Eat will endure for decades to come.

Adulthood Is a Myth: A Sarah's Scribbles Collection,Sarah Andersen,"Paperback,– 8 Mar 2016",4.6,70.0,"Do you love networking to advance your career? Is adulthood an exciting new challenge for which you feel fully prepared? Ugh. Please go away.

2016 GOODREADS CHOICE AWARD WINNER FOR GRAPHIC NOVELS AND COMICS!

These casually drawn, perfectly on-point comics by the hugely popular young Brooklyn-based artist Sarah Andersen are for the rest of us. They document the wasting of entire beautiful weekends on the internet, the unbearable agony of holding hands on the street with a gorgeous guy, and dreaming all day of getting home and back into pajamas. In other words, the horrors and awkwardnesses of young modern life. Oh and they are totally not autobiographical. At all.

Adulthood Is a Myth presents many fan favorites plus dozens of all-new comics exclusive to this book. Like the work of fellow Millennial authors Allie Brosh, Grace Helbig, and Gemma Correll, Sarah's frankness on personal issues like body image, self-consciousness, introversion, relationships, and the frequency of bra-washing makes her comics highly relatable and deeply hilarious.",Humour (Books),Humour,2.7781512503836434

He finally highlights the emergence of a new quality of cooperation between the Indian and the Armenian people at the end of the 20th century, which came as a result of the establishment of official ties between the newly independent Republic of Armenia and India on August 31, 1992, and presents his own inspirational vision for the future of this cooperation, based on his insights as a key player in its development.
The readers will be struck with the drastic contrast between the harmonious integration and prosperity of Armenians in Indian society in the past and the apparent absence of Armenians from the landscape of contemporary Indian culture, business and politics. The exodus of the erstwhile prosperous Armenian population from India was nothing but a misread of the situation and a miscalculation of the country's future on the part of Indian-Armenians in the 20th century.
India- Armenia: So Far Yet So Close is intended to trigger interest in its theme, help readers to visualize the distant past and introduce unfamiliar readers with the vibrant history shared between the two ancient people.",International Relations,Politics,2.303196057420489

Everyone's a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Too: A Book,Jomny Sun,"Hardcover,– 27 Jun 2017",4.6,7.0,"The illustrated story of a lonely alien sent to observe Earth, where he meets all sorts of creatures with all sorts of perspectives on life, love, and happiness, while learning to feel a little better about himself, based on the enormously popular twitter account. He also gradually improves his spelling.
Everyone’s a Aliebn When ur a Aliebn Too is the story of Jomny, an alien sent to study Earth. Always feeling apart, even among his species, Jomny becomes determined to make friends among the animals he meets. There is a bear tired of other creatures running in fear, an egg struggling to decide what to hatch into, an owl working its way to being wise, a turtle attempting to learn camouflage, and many more.

The characters are unique and inventive-bees think long and hard about their role in the hive, a Turkey helps Jomny make peace with the vagaries of life (right before Thanksgiving), and an introverted hedgehog slowly lets Jomny see its artistic insecurities.
It’s also the story behind the widely-shared and typo-filled @jonnysun twitter account. Since the beginning, Sun intentionally tweeted from an outsider’s perspective, creating a truly distinct voice.

He can be funny:
‘”I hav cat-like reflexes’
‘prove it’
‘looks at cat’
(instantly) ‘I like that cat’”

Poignat:
“When u die, they play u a recording of all the times someone said ‘I love you” to u and u didn’t hear it.”

But usually, he’s somewhere in between:
“im like a onion. Peel back the layers and u’ll see that deep down inside im just a smaller more afraid onion.”

Now, that outsider has taken shape in the character of Jomny, who observes Earth with the same intelligent, empathetic, and charmingly naïve voice that won over his fans on social media. The book is almost entirely new material, with a handful of thoughts and sentiments worked into the story, or used as jumping off points. New fans will find it organic, and old fans will delight at seeing the clever words that made them fans in the first place.

Through this story of a lost, lonely and confused Alien finding friendship, acceptance, and love among the animals and plants of Earth, we will all learn how to be a little more human.",Humour (Books),Humour,2.934498451243568

Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon,Kim Zetter,"Paperback,– 1 Sep 2015",5.0,3.0,"Top cybersecurity journalist Kim Zetter tells the story behind the virus that sabotaged Iran’s nuclear efforts and shows how its existence has ushered in a new age of warfare—one in which a digital attack can have the same destructive capability as a megaton bomb.
 
In January 2010, inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency noticed that centrifuges at an Iranian uranium enrichment plant were failing at an unprecedented rate. The cause was a complete mystery—apparently as much to the technicians replacing the centrifuges as to the inspectors observing them.
 
Then, five months later, a seemingly unrelated event occurred: A computer security firm in Belarus was called in to troubleshoot some computers in Iran that were crashing and rebooting repeatedly.
 
 At first, the firm’s programmers believed the malicious code on the machines was a simple, routine piece of malware. But as they and other experts around the world investigated, they discovered a mysterious virus of unparalleled complexity.
 
They had, they soon learned, stumbled upon the world’s first digital weapon. For Stuxnet, as it came to be known, was unlike any other virus or worm built before: Rather than simply hijacking targeted computers or stealing information from them, it escaped the digital realm to wreak actual, physical destruction on a nuclear facility. 
 
In these pages, Wired journalist Kim Zetter draws on her extensive sources and expertise to tell the story behind Stuxnet’s planning, execution, and discovery, covering its genesis in the corridors of Bush’s White House and its unleashing on systems in Iran—and telling the spectacular, unlikely tale of the security geeks who managed to unravel a sabotage campaign years in the making.
 
But Countdown to Zero Day ranges far beyond Stuxnet itself. Here, Zetter shows us how digital warfare developed in the US. She takes us inside today’s flourishing zero-day “grey markets,” in which intelligence agencies and militaries pay huge sums for the malicious code they need to carry out infiltrations and attacks. She reveals just how vulnerable many of our own critical systems are to Stuxnet-like strikes, from nation-state adversaries and anonymous hackers alike—and shows us just what might happen should our infrastructure be targeted by such an attack.
 
Propelled by Zetter’s unique knowledge and access, and filled with eye-opening explanations of the technologies involved, Countdown to Zero Day is a comprehensive and prescient portrait of a world at the edge of a new kind of war.",Political Freedom & Security (Books),Politics,2.9400181550076634

The City of Brass,S. A. Chakraborty,"Paperback,– 4 Apr 2018",4.3,14.0,"Discover this spellbinding debut from S.A. Chakraborty.
‘An extravagant feast of a book spicy and bloody, dizzyingly magical and still, somehow, utterly believable’ Laini Taylor, Sunday Times and New York Times bestselling author
Among the bustling markets of eighteenth century Cairo, the city’s outcasts eke out a living swindling rich Ottoman nobles and foreign invaders alike.
But alongside this new world the old stories linger. Tales of djinn and spirits. Of cities hidden among the swirling sands of the desert, full of enchantment, desire and riches. Where magic pours down every street, hanging in the air like dust.
Many wish their lives could be filled with such wonder, but not Nahri. She knows the trades she uses to get by are just tricks and sleights of hand: there’s nothing magical about them. She only wishes to one day leave Cairo, but as the saying goes.
Be careful what you wish for.",Action & Adventure (Books),Action & Adventure,2.526339277389844
