1448,Is my interval training routine effective for mountain bike training?,"During these winter months I am currently attending the gym 3 times a week. On each of the days I start my training on an exercise bike with the following:


5 minute warm up
30 minutes, 1 minute hard, 1 minute recovery
5 minute warm down


I am using a specific interval training setting on the bike. I preset the training to level 15, which is a high resistance and as much as I can take.

Hard is a cadence of between 80-90rpm high resistance. Recovery is a cadence of 60prm and the resistance backs off considerably, I imagine to approximately level 7.

My heart rate towards the end of the session reaches 170–190bpm, and I am working flat-out. I turn 30 in March, am 5' 8"" and weigh approx 168lbs.

Does this training routine seem sensible for building strength and speed on the mountain? Should I be changing up the training with other types of bike training?

It is also worth noting that after the interval training I perform free weight strength training too.
",DigiKev,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/3323,"At the end of this workout are you 'smoked'? If so, then these are 'anaerobic endurance' intervals. Some training plans suggest just starting these 6-8 weeks before your first ""A race""

Some plans suggest you work on ""muscular endurance"" first with long fairly hard efforts = 10m plus - then 6-8 weeks prior add anaerobic endurance intervals. The two biggest abilities for MTB are said to be muscular and anaerobic endurance.

1721,What are the implications of Emmet's autonomous movement?,"During The Lego Movie we learn that the whole LEGO world is actually a universe existing within ours, or to be precise, in the basement of a real human family and that the whole story is actually played out by a little boy named Finn and a way for him to cope with the conflict of his strict and fantasy-inhibiting father. And indeed this is again strengthened when we see that the actions as performed by his father when supposedly ""repairing the mess"" that Finn created are directly represented by Lord Business' micromanagers performing them inside the in-universe viewpoint of the other LEGO figures.

Upto this point that is a reasonable and obvious representation to me and even Emmet's direct witness of the universe behind his, our real world, is nothing but him seeing the strips behind the course of his own universe, however he managed to overcome this boundary between dimensions. But the single-most action that completely shatters this whole viewpoint is the incident, when Emmet manages to move completely on his own, thus directly interfering with our universe on his own and it seems to me that there is no way to bring this in congruence to our own physical reality, not even when accepting the LEGO world and its course as an emanation of Finn's fantasy, since Finn didn't do anything at all.

So what are we to make of this incident? Does it have any deeper implications for the depicted realities? Does this establish the LEGO figures as existent and sentient within our physical reality outside of our mere fantasy? Does it have any further signficance for the meaning of the whole story and actually extend the rather simple and obvious kid's fantasy interpretation of the story in a much more elaborate way I have missed? Or is this just to be brushed off as nothing of relevance?
",Napoleon Wilson,https://movies.stackexchange.com/users/49,"The way I took it as that both universes exist side by side (and not subservient to each other) and incidents in one universe affect the other. The causality traffic might seem a bit heavy sided towards Finn's universe being the dominant one, but on closer look you see that this isn't completely true. The Man Upstairs' LEGO policies have certainly shaped Emmet's universe greatly. But Emmet, being Finn's chosen one, has reversed the flow of effects. Not only was he able to cross between his world to Finn's (and back again), but his reformation of President Business has also somehow triggered The Man Upstairs to look differently at his hobby.

In short, Emmet's world is not a fantasy or part of Finn's world, but a distinct one that has a border with Finn's world where cause and effect can cross.

7923,Why not have the gears inside the bottom bracket?,"Looking into an IGH it seems the biggest disadvantage is having a huge amount of rotating mass. I've seen one handmade bike where the IGH sits above the bracket, inside a carbon fibre shroud around the place some bikes have rear suspension. There are two chains, one driving the IGH and another to drive the rear wheel. 

Why not have an internally geared bottom bracket where the cranks drive the input shaft and the crank ring rotates at a ratio selectable by the gear lever? 

Then the rear wheel could have a single drive wheel driven by a chain or belt and a lightweight hub just solid enough to mount the spokes and disc. Then you could have mud-free gearing while reducing rotating mass even below what you have with a conventional cassette... and given that you have thrown out the bottom bracket the overall weight gain would be less.

Quite a job for the home builder to adapt an existing hub I guess but it should be possible.

1628,A family of polynomials with symmetric galois group,"Consider the following family of polynomials in $K[x,y]$, where $K$ has characteristic zero:

$f_n(x,y)=(x+y)^n+(x-1)y^n,$

for $n\geq 3$.  I can prove that $f_n(x,y)$ has an irreducible factor of degree $n-1$ in $x$. I also know that the galois group of $f_n$ over $K(y)$ is the symmetric group of degree $n-1$, but am having trouble proving this.

Here is an alternative form for $f_n$: make the substitution $x\rightarrow xy$ and divide by $y^n$.  this gives:

$g_n(x,y)=(x+1)^n+yx-1.$

Substituting $-n$ for $y$ in $g_n(x,y)$ we get:

$g_n(x,-n)=x^2h(x),$

where $h(x)$ is separable (EDIT: $h(x)$ is the subject of this question).

Alternatively, substituting $x\rightarrow x-1$ into $g_n(x,y)$ gives us a polynomial which factors as:

$(x-1)(x^{n-1}+x^{n-2}+\ldots +x^2+x+y+1)$

It seems as though it shouldn't be hard to show that some specialisation of $y$ into this gives a polynomial with galois group $S_{n-1}$ over $K$...but I'm well and truly stuck.

Any advice much appreciated! 
",MrB,https://mathoverflow.net/users/2189,"[Edited mostly to incorporate references etc. from Michael Zieve]

The polynomial $(x^n-1)/(x-1) - y$ has Galois group $S_{n-1}$ over ${\bf C}(y)$ for each $n$, as expected.  This answers one of the three problems; the question statements asserts that they are equivalent, which doesn't seem to be the case (see my comment there), so I hope I'm answering the intended one.

The proof combines group theory and polynomial algebra (as might be expect) with algebraic topology, which might be a bit less expected.  The connection is as follows.  Let $S$ be the Riemann sphere with coordinate $y$, let $P(x,y)$ be any polynomial of degree $d&gt;0$ in $x$, and let $S'$ be the Riemann surface corresponding to $P(x,y)=0$.  The rational function $y$ on $S'$ gives a map $S' \rightarrow S$; let $B = \lbrace y_1,\ldots,y_b\rbrace$ be its set of branch points, and fix some $\eta \in S$ not in $B$.  Then $\pi_1(S-B,\phantom.\eta)$ is a free group on $b-1$ generators, with generators $g_1,\ldots,g_b$ (where each $g_j$ is a loop from the base point $\eta$ around $y_j$ and back to $\eta$) subject to the single relation $g_1 g_2 \cdots g_b = 1$.  These lift to automorphisms $\tilde g_j$ of $S' - y^{-1}(B)$ such that $y = y \cdot \tilde g_j$, and thus to permutations $\pi_j$ of the $d$ sheets of $S'$ above $S$.  Then the key fact is that


  The Galois group of $P(x,y)$ as a polynomial over ${\bf C}(y)$ is the subgroup of $S_d$ generated by the permutations $\pi_j$.


In our case $P\phantom.$ has the form $p(x) - y$.  In general I think it is known which polynomials (or even rational functions) $p$ yield $p(x)-y$ with Galois group other than $S_d$, but it's not easy and involves the classification of finite simple groups!
[Actually even less is known; the groups have been determined, but the polynomials, not quite, even in the polynomial case.  See below.  But this is tangential to the question at hand (albeit a fascinating tangent) because the ensuing argument is enough.]
Fortunately in our case the following sufficient condition is all we need:


  Let $p\in {\bf C}[X]$ be a polynomial of degree $d$.  Assume that the derivative $p'$ has distinct roots $x_1,\ldots,x_{d-1}$, and that the numbers $y_j = p(x_j)$ are also pairwise distinct.  Then $p(x)-y$ has Galois group $S_d$ over ${\bf C}(y)$.


[Naturally this result is not new, but I was still surprised to learn from Mike Zieve of its true age and pedigree: Hilbert (1892)!  See below.]

Proof: Here $b=d$ and the branch points are $y_1,\ldots,y_{d-1}$ and $y_d = \infty$.  Since $P$ is a polynomial, $\pi_d$ is a $d$-cycle.  (This already proves that the Galois group is transitive, that is, that the polynomial is irreducible; but we already knew this because it is obviously irreducible over ${\bf C}[y]$.)  Each $\pi_j$ for $j&lt;d$ is a simple transposition.  So we have $d-1$ transpositions whose product is a $d$-cycle.  But we readily prove the following by induction on $d$:


  Let $s_1,\ldots,s_{d-1}$ be $d-1$ simple transpositions of $d$ letters.  Then TFAE: (i) $s_1 s_2 \cdots s_{d-1}$ is a $d$-cycle; (ii) $s_1,\ldots,s_{d-1}$ generate a transitive subgroup of $S_d$; (iii) $s_1,\ldots,s_{d-1}$ generate $S_d$; (iv) the graph on $d$ vertices in which two vertices are adjacent iff they're permuted by some $s_j$ is a tree.


Here (i) is satisfied, so (iii) holds and the Galois group is $S_d$ as claimed.

[NB we cannot drop the condition that the $y_j$ be distinct; e.g. the Čebyšev polynomial $T_d$ has dihedral Galois group, which is smaller than $S_d$ once $d&gt;3$, even though $T'_d$ has distinct roots $x_j$, because $T_d(x_j) = \pm 1$ for each of them.]

It remains to check that the hypothesis on $p$ is satisfied when $d=n-1$ and $p=(X^n-1)/(X-1)$.  For lack of a better idea I did this by computing the discriminant of the polynomial
$$
q(y) = \frac{(n-1)^{n-1} y^n - n^n (y-1)^{n-1}}{(y-n)^2} \qquad (1)
$$
of degree $n-2$ whose roots are the $y_j$, and checking that it is nonzero; in fact
$$
\mathop{\rm disc} q(y) = \pm 2 \Delta_{n-1} \Delta_n
$$
where $\Delta_m := m^{(m-1)(m-3)}$ (and the sign depends on $n \bmod 4$).  The formula for $q$ was obtained from the familiar expression $\pm \bigl( (n-1)^{n-1} A^n - n^n B^{n-1} \bigr)$ for the discriminant of the trinomial $x^n - Ax + B$.  It follows that the numerator of (1) is $\pm$ the discriminant of $x^n - xy + (y-1) = (x-1) (p(x)-y)$ as a polynomial in $x$, whence (1) soon follows; substituting $y = nz/(nz-(n-1))$, and using the covariance of the discriminant under ${\rm PGL}_2$ together with the same trinomial formula, soon gives the claimed $\pm 2 \Delta_{n-1} \Delta_n$ (the factor of $2$ arises at the end from a double application of L'H&ocirc;pital's rule), QED.

Here are some relevant references and additional information.

Polynomials with distinct critical values: This is in section 4.4 of Serre's Topics in Galois Theory (Boston: Jones &amp; Bartlett 1992), as is the reference to Hilbert: ""Ueber die irreduzibilität genzen rationalen Funktionen mit ganzzahligen Koeffizienten"", J. reine angew. Math. (""Crelle's J."") 110, 104-129 (= Ges. Abh. II, 264-286).  Serre gives such polynomials the suggestive name ""Morse functions"". M. Zieve also notes that a 1959 paper by Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer in Acta Arith. (MR0113844 (22 #4675)) attributes to Davenport the equivalent formulation


  [The Galois group of $f(x) = y$] is the symmetric group if the discriminant of the discriminant of $f(x)-y$ does not vanish.


They call this a ""more euphonious form""; that's a matter of taste, but at any rate it's a memorable formulation, and the one that ended up being used here.

Exceptional Galois groups of $p(x) = y$.  The primitive groups that can occur are described by Peter Müller in a paper Primitive monodromy groups of polynomials.  They are the symmetric and alternating groups, plus cyclic and dihedral groups (for polynomials equivalent to powers and Čebyšev), and a finite but substantial list of exceptional possibilities.  It is hopeless to classify all cases of alternating Galois group.  For the rest it can be done, but not easily.  Some are exhibited by Cassou-Nogues and Couveignes in an Acta Arith. paper Factorisations explicites de $g(y)-h(z)$; most others were done by Mike Zieve himself; and the final case, polynomials of degree $23$ with Galois group the Mathieu group $M_{23}$, I computed only a few days ago after Mike noted it was still open (they're defined over the quadratic extension of ${\bf Q}(\sqrt{-23})$ of discriminant $3 \cdot 23^3$).

When $p$ is allowed to be a rational function, even the list of groups is not yet known.  Mike notes that this ""ties in with the 'genus zero program' initiated by Guralnick and Thompson"" that was completed in a 2001 paper by Frohardt and Magaard in the Annals of Math.

5254,How can I tell if a downloaded ISO is complete?,"I just ran into a nasty problem with an ISO download from Microsoft.  I successfully burnt it to a rewritable DVD, and copied the contents to the local hard drive on another machine, but when I went to run them they were corrupt.  It turns out the download had been truncated.

Now, OK, sometimes that happens - but it surprised me that the truncated file (which was only slightly more than 60% of the actual ISO) burnt successfully and seemed to be presenting me with a sensible file system, to the extent that I could (apparently) successfully copy the files.

So, is there some way I could have tested the file to see if it was complete or not?  The MS web site did not provide any information about the expected size, so I'm looking for a generic solution: given an ISO file which may or may not be truncated, is there some way to tell?  Do commonly used CD/DVD (data) formats include any embedded information about how much data is supposed to be on the disk, or even better, some kind of CRC?

A solution that detects most truncated images will be accepted, it doesn't need to be perfect.  (I'd prefer something that doesn't give false positives, though.)

[Addendum: a comparison of the disk burnt with the truncated image with the files extracted from the full image suggests that chunks of the data from many of the files were replaced with random information, perhaps from the contents of a previous burn to the same rewritable disk.]
",Harry Johnston,https://superuser.com/users/96662,"If the source did not provide any checksums for you, you should first check the file size and see if it matches. If not, it means that your download is ended prematurely. 

Also in linux, you can use wget, with -c command to continue aborted downloads. I have never tried to continue a download started from another application (mostly browser) but I think it should be fine.

I always use wget as a download manager as it fails rarely and allows continuing aborted downloads. One should have a download manager in their tools for downloading large files consistently even though one does not use it every day.

6827,Does one need a master's in math before taking a PhD in math in Europe?,"This question is a variation of my earlier questions.

Okay so in the US, I guess one does not need a master's in math before pursuing a PhD in math since the US apparently usually assumes only a bachelor's.

What about in Europe? Technically, my master's is in mathematical finance not mathematics. So I didn't have research experience in looking through (pure) math books or articles in order to try to prove something theoretical or anything like that except for a few problem sets.

On an answer to one of my previous questions, user deviantfan commented that:

""In many european countries, it´s not even allowed/possible to skip the master degree.""

Perhaps my question may be rephrased:


  Is the master's in X PhD requirement in Europe satisfied by a
  master's in Applied X rather than Pure X?

",Jack Bauer,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/22511,"I'd say that one would need a Master's in Math or its equivalent. Then the question becomes, is your degree in Mathematical Finance an equivalent.""

Hopefully, you will have had the core courses in mathematics such as real and complex analysis and advanced calculus. Perhaps your mathematical Finance degree will differ from a true math degree in ""engineering type"" applications, such as stochastic partial differential equations. If that is the case, you may be ok. Perhaps, at worst, you need to take 2-3 ""traditional"" math courses as a special student to make up for what you lack.

If you lack a traditional core curriculum, that would be different of course. Ultimately, it is for the faculties of the schools you apply to, to decide. And there is no one university ""monolith"" in Europe, only numerous schools, with meaningful variations in their admissions criteria.

5563,Are these adjoint functors to/from the category of monoids with semigroup homomorphisms?,"Do the forgetful functors $G_H:\bf Monoid \to \bf Semigroup^1$ and $G_O:\bf Semigroup^1 \to \bf Semigroup$ have left and/or right adjoints? Here $\bf Semigroup$ is the category of semigroups with semigroup homomorphisms, $\bf Semigroup^1$ is the category of monoids (semigroups with identity) with semigroup homomorphisms, and $\bf Monoid$ is the category of monoids with monoid homomorphisms (the image of the identity is the identity).

An interesting functor $F_H:\bf Semigroup^1 \to \bf Monoid$ is given by the functor which leaves the monoid objects unchanged, and modifies the homomorphisms by replacing the image of the identity by the identity of the target monoid. Is this a left or right adjoint functor to $G_H$?

A nice functor $F_O:\bf Semigroup \to \bf Semigroup^1$ is the one which leaves monoids unchanged, and adjoins an identity element to semigroups missing an identity element. The homomorphisms are extended by mapping the newly adoint identity element to the identity element of the target monoid. Is this a left or a right adjoint functor to $G_O$, or both?

A well known functor $F:\bf Semigroup \to \bf Monoid$ is the one which adjoins to each semigroup an identity (independent of whether it already has one), and extends the homomorphisms by mapping the newly adoint identity element to the newly adjoint identity element of the target monoid. I have seen the assumption (statement) that this is the left adjoint of the forgetful functor. Is this correct?
",Thomas Klimpel,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/12490,"Functor $F\circ G_{O}:\mathbf{Semigroup}^{\mathbf{1}}\rightarrow\mathbf{Monoid}$
serves as left adjoint of functor $G_{H}:\mathbf{Monoid}\rightarrow\mathbf{Semigroup}^{\mathbf{1}}$.

Does functor $G_{O}:\mathbf{Semigroup}^{\mathbf{1}}\rightarrow\mathbf{Semigroup}$
have a left adjoint? Let's say it has and let's denote it as $K:\mathbf{Semigroup}\rightarrow\mathbf{Semigroup}^{\mathbf{1}}$.
Then the composition $F\circ G_{O}\circ K:\mathbf{Semigroup}\rightarrow\mathbf{Monoid}$
should serve as left adjoint of $G=G_{O}\circ G_{H}:\mathbf{Monoid}\rightarrow\mathbf{Semigroup}$.
This according to the rule $\left(G_{O}\circ G_{H}\right)^{ad}=G_{H}^{ad}\circ G_{O}^{ad}$.
Then $F$ and $F\circ G_{O}\circ K$ must be isomorphic functors (both
left adjoints of $G$). However, if you start with an object $S\in\mathbf{Semigroup}$
having no identity and a finite underlying set, then $K\left(S\right)$
must have at least $1$ element more (the missing identity must be
'added') and $F\circ G_{O}\left(K\left(S\right)\right)=F\left(K\left(S\right)\right)$
will on its turn have $1$ element more than $K\left(S\right)$ (again
an identiy is added). Then $F\circ G_{O}\left(K\left(S\right)\right)=F\left(K\left(S\right)\right)$
has at least $2$ elements more than $S$ in contrast with $F\left(S\right)$
that has exactly $1$ element more. This shows that the functors cannot
be isomorphic. The conclusion is that $G_{O}:\mathbf{Semigroup}^{\mathbf{1}}\rightarrow\mathbf{Semigroup}$
has no left adjoint.

",Willow,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/3494,"EPS, is an acronym for Encapsulated Post Script - it is a package of information (vector and raster elements) used for cross-platform print documents.  Most would considered this a legacy format, well supported for print. In terms of vector information - it is probably the best choice for what you describe, Willow. 

The EPS format can be used for RGB images - but in fact EPS will never be efficient for rgb, as it is designed for post-script print files.

Your vector images will always be printable as EPS, but it's not a particularly efficient file format and if you do include raster images, the transparency is not well accomodated (as you may have to save the alpha channel separately)

There should be a go-to summary of file formats and their strengths and weaknesses.
For example, you are incorrect about PSD files and resizing. All raster images will pixelate when enlarged.

Consider the following



Something like this. Except I feel like the light will escape given enough time. Also, the object has to be finite in size (infinite is cheating). If there's a proof that no such container exists then that's fine too.

On these two pictures, the incident ray was directed at slightly different angles. It is quite clear, that there exists some limiting case between these two angles, in which the light will not escape either downwards nor upwards. Obviously, we could also use such a system in a bottle.

However, it should be noted that the path of the ray is unstable. If we had taken account also wave-optics, the wave would have ""leaked"" away very fast from he unstable equilibrium. It turns out, that taking into account quantum mechanics, such a system could be used to heat a hotter body (inside to bottle) with a colder body (outside), which is a contradiction.

7999,Where is my power going?,"We just got an overly large (several hundred dollars over normal) electric bill from the city.

Being a bit of a diy I picked up an ammeter to to track down the reason. None of my circuits are clocking in over 2 amps in normal usage. I tried powering up everything in the house including all of the major appliances. 

I only came up with a total of 22 amps, absolute max draw. US standard 110V.

I did the math but I wasn't able to crack our normal $150 / month (calculated out using the local kilowatt hour pricing).

What the heck is going on? Anything more for me to do before calling the electrician?

Edit:

The meter box is mounted to the side of the house, under a overhang.

When I used the ammeter I was working off the main hot line from the meter when I powered everything up. 

I did see the other diy post. 

We do have central air, howeverit was a lot cooler last month vs the same time last year. The usage shouldnt have spiked, at least that much.

The price per killowatt hour is comperable to last year as well.

We generally clock in at around 1200 to 1800 kilowatt hours. Last month was a bit over 2800.

We already tried (unsuccessfully) to lodge a complaint with the electric company.

The odd thing is the variance -$150 one month and near $1000 the next, with no noticible change in utilization patterns.

You can increase or reduce the bs(block size) based on your i/o capacity(fast increase,slow decrease),then copy the back.sda with scp or rsync on backup.
Later you can mount the image and recovery the files,this will work if sda is not broken disk,if is corrupted you can try a fsck.
Rsync works for files,i have never tried on block device but i think rsync sda copy only the sda block file(size 0) on remote backup
If the problem is unavaliable partition, you will resolve nothing with rsync,you must use kpartx,search google for kpartx lvm

Now, you say you get about 32771 shared memory segments, which is also about 32768 (or 2 to the 15) which suggests a signed 16-bit int is the limiting factor. And what kernel are you running (as this will have its own limits)? The two may be related.

The problem is, that I can't get app.user object (returned as NULL) or current app.request.locale (always returned as default locale) inside this template.

I have even tried to override the twig exception controller and dump a current locale (Request::getLocale()) or get user - the results are the same - default locale and NULL for user.

Then I decided to dig deeper and found a dozens of listeners (locale listeners, exception liteners, ...) and tried to debug/fix/test there, but I didn't proceed any further.

By the way, I have overrided the 500 error page too, and everything is fine there. Well I guess that when 500 error (exception) is thrown, the symfony has already set up user/locale/etc, because it already has got to the target (controller/action) and other listeners been already executed. But 404 error (NotFoundHttpException) is being thrown BEFORE Symfony targets the action...

Some words about project: symfony 2.4.8, doctrine, Gedmo extensions/stof bundle, JMS i18n routing bundle.

Symfony version: v2.4.8
JMS I18n Routing bundle: 1.1.1

Appreciate your help.

Is there an insurance company involved? When there is one involved it can take weeks or months before the hospital determines what the individual owes. The co-pays, coverages, and limits can be very confusing.

4337,Is it an absolute must that we ignore/delete all compiled files before committing?,"I am working on a Drupal theme. I am going to be using ""intermediary"" languages to develop it, ie Stylus for styles, and CoffeeScript for some of the front-end scripts.

I am going to be using a git hosting service to be able to share the code among colleges. I am also going to be using it to update the code locally and then push onto hosting service, to be later pulled by the live drupal site.

This makes things really elegant.

However, I have noticed that a lot of developers tend to .gitignore all compiled code.

If it were a good practice, I would've loved to follow it, if and only if there wasn't this one issue: recompiling all the code that is needed in order for the theme to work out correctly.

This means that when I do a pull, I will have to recompile all the CSS and JavaScript code. Now, if I were to do a pull on the live site, there's a risk that a user goes to the site right at the moment I do the pull. No styles and scripts will be loaded on the user's end, so long as the code hasn't compiled.

Of course, compiling takes about a second, and the user might probably think to him/herself ""meh, it was just my internet connection.""

But there is also the issue that the server doesn't have the compilers installed to begin with. So now, I would do a pull, but there will be no styles, and no scripts.

Is it an absolute must that I delete all compiled code, or can I go ahead and include them in the commit?

User.Company or Company.Users works fine.





Project has_and_belongs_to_many Users   
Users has_and_belongs_to_many Project

Implemented via has_and_belongs_to_many relation using in projetcs_users table

Project.Users or User.Projects works fine.




The real problem comes when I want them to join as following as well : 


Company belong_to Owners  (:through => User)
Owner has_one Company

---A company can have multiple owners but one user can own just one company. He can't be owner of multiple companies.

---A user may or may not be owner of a company but always belong to some company.
---A user cannot be part of two companies.
Project has_one Project_manager  (:through => User)
Project_manager belongs_to Projects

---A Project can have just one Project_manager but one can be project manager of multiple projects.

Company.Owners

@owner = User.find(Company.owner_id)

4300,k-center algorithm in one-dimensional space,"I'm aware of the general k-center approximation algorithm, but my professor (this is a question from a CS class) says that in a one-dimensional space, the problem can be solved (optimal solution found, not an approximation) in O(n^2) polynomial time without depending on k or using dynamic programming.

A general description of the k-center problem: Given a set of nodes in an n-dimensional space, cluster them into k clusters such that the ""radius"" of each cluster (distance from furthest node to its center node) is minimized. A more formal and detailed description can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_k-center

As you might expect, I can't figure out how this is possible. The part currently causing me problems is how the runtime can not rely on k.

The nature of the problem causes me to try to step through the nodes on a sort of number line and try to find points to put boundaries, marking off the edges of each cluster that way. But this would require a runtime based on k.

The O(n^2) runtime though makes me think it might involve filling out an nxn array with the distance between two nodes in each entry.

Any explanation on how this is works or tips on how to figure it out would be very helpful.

The java class file is based on a spec so anyone can read into it. A tool like JD-GUI will tear into your source code easily. It is not a 'feature' per se. While 100% reverse-engineering is not possible, most of your code can be reverse engineered.

Depends. The point of the obfuscator is to remove any meaningful names and try to introduce confusion in the code without impacting performance. Most developers are great at obfuscating code themselves :) Pro-guard is pretty good at obfuscation.

2276,Protractor test vs long-polling,"I have an Angular web app that continuously listens for notifications from the backend via long-poll:

scope.notification = $resource('/notification').get();


This request never completes in the test environment. This is a problem for Protractor, because it wants to wait for all outstanding HTTP requests to finish.

I see a number of potential solutions, but have some issues with all of them.

I do not see a way to tell Protractor to ignore this request. Issuing it from $interval (which itself is ignored) is not a solution. Protractor will not wait for the request to be sent, but once it's sent, it will still wait for it to complete.

So I'm trying not to send this request when running the tests. But how do I know I'm in a test?


I could add a flag to the URL (?protractor=true). But my web app modifies the URL all the time, so it would get cleared quickly.
I tried setting a variable: browser.executeScript('window.runningProtractorTests = true;'); But it seems Protractor will wait for the page to sync first before running executeScript. And I'm sending the request right away when the page loads.
I could set a cookie. But it's fairly cumbersome, e.g. I'd have to load the page twice. (See issue 341 for more difficulties.)
I could set a user agent. It's not easy either. I would need to set browser flags for each browser in the config file. I do not want to completely override the user agent (to Protractor, for example) out of fear that my libraries may rely on interpreting the user agent string, so I'd have to figure out the right string.
I could check if the server is running on a specific port. But then a year from now someone will try to run the production server on the same port and not understand why the notifications don't work.
Making the test backend complete the request immediately does not help, because it's immediately sent again whenever it completes. But I guess I could introduce a special ""you are in a test"" notification and stop the polling when this is received. This would mean a (small) change to our protocol, so I'd rather avoid it if possible.


Is there no straightforward way to do this?

2627,Why all the dice?,"I'm asking more as an outside observer, and not with anyone who has any grievance with how games are played, nor am I judging or criticizing anything.

I've just always wondered, why use all the different types of dice? Why a 4 sided die for one thing, three 6 sided dice for another, and a twenty sided dice for something else? Couldn't you use, just for example, two 10 sided dice to represent a percentage between 1 and 100 (one die is tens and the other is ones, and they're differentiated by colour), and then use that for all instances?

If you needed to decide something was a one in four possibility, you just declare it a 25% chance, and roll the two tens. No matter what kind of possibility you wanted that are currently represented by various combinations of dice, it seems to me you could represent it within a range of one to one hundred. 

Sure, a bag of all different shaped dice looks kind of cool, but is there a reason for them that goes beyond aesthetics? With just two 10 sided dice (or three if you wanted really fine gradients of percentage) wouldn't that make things simpler and more consistent without losing any of the variety of chances taken?

I thought maybe it had to do with probabilistic outcomes. For instance, if you roll two 6 sided dice, I believe that you're more likely to come up with some combination that adds up to 7 than you are with a combination that adds up to 2 or 12. So there's a bell curve of possible outcomes. Nonetheless, maybe I'm just not well versed enough in probabilities enough to see a difference, but I still think you could get the same equivalent likelihoods of an outcome by using a straight percentage, adjusting up or down depending on what you needed.

Again, I'm not trying to be contrarian, I'm just curious. Is there an objective reason for all the different dice?
",Questioner,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/10772,"Short answer: Yes, your hunch is right: because probability curves, and easy access to them. 

Sure, you could calculate (for example by using AnyDice) in advance the percentage chances of rolling a 2, a 3, a 4 etc on a 3d6, but mapping and rolling everything so would get messy and totally inconvenient practically in an instant. You want predictably varying distribution, bell curves, etc, and all this at your fingertips without having to use a calculator or other app.

Also, dice are nice. It's great to roll them. Look, how they twist and spin and decide your fate. :D

7381,How do you prepare for out of memory conditions?,"This can be easy for games with well defined scope, but the question is about sandbox games, where the player is allowed to create and build anything.

Possible techniques:


Use memory pools with upper limit.
Delete objects that are no longer needed periodically.
Allocate extra amount of memory at the beginning so it can be freed
later as a recovery mechanism. I would say around 2-4 MBs.


This is more likely to happen in mobile/console platforms where memory is usually limited unlike your 16 GB PC. I am assuming you have full control over memory allocation/deallocation and no garbage collection involved. That's why am tagging this as C++.

Please note that I am not talking about Effective C++ Item 7 ""Be prepared for out-of-memory conditions"", even though it's relevant, I would like to see an answer more related to game development, where you usually have more control over what's happening.

To summarize the question , how do you prepare for out of memory conditions for sandbox games, when you are targeting a platform with limited memory console/mobile ?
",concept3d,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/5440,"The application is usually tested on the targeted platform with the worst case scenarios and you will always be prepared for the platform you are targeted. Ideally the application should never crash, but other that, optimization for specific devices is the only thing you can do, there are little choices when you face low memory warning.

The best practice is to have preallocated pools and the game uses from the very beginning all the needed memory. If your game has a maximum of 100 units than have a pool for 100 units and that's it. If 100 units exceeds the mem requirements for one targeted device then you can optimize the unit to use less memory or change the design to a maximum of 90 unit. There should be no case where you can build unlimited things , there should always be a limit. It would be very bad for a sandbox game to use new for each instance because you can never predict the mem usage and a crash is a lot worst than a limitation.

Also the the game design should always have in mind the lowest targeted devices because if you base your design with ""unlimited"" things in it then it will be a lot harder to solve the memory problems or change the design later on.

",Maestro1024,https://serverfault.com/users/12050,"Depends what you mean by a ""32-bit host"".  If you mean hardware with a 32-bit processor that doesn't have 64-bit capabilities, then no, you can't do that through virtualisation - you would need an emulator rather than virtualisation and I'm not aware of one existing.

If you mean on a machine with a 32-bit OS, then again, it's not possible to run a 64-bit guest on a 32-bit OS without emulation (something would need to translate the 64-bit instructions into 32-bit instructions) unless either (a) the 32-bit OS allows 64-bit applications (like Mac OS X) or (b) you can bypass the OS with a hypervisor.  I'm not aware of a 32-bit type II virtualisation product for the Mac that allows a 64-bit OS to run as a 64-bit app.  In fact, I'm not aware of a type II virtualisation product for the Mac at all.

If you're using a hypervisor (type I virtualisation) like Hyper-V, VMWare ESX, Virtual Box, etc, then it should be possible, because the guest OS does not run on the host OS, but on the hypervisor.  Indeed, the ""host"" OS actually runs on the hypervisor too.

1618,Is there any significant ranking penalty for using 302 redirects to force HTTPS?,"We have a site with:


Decent ranking on certain targeted keywords.
An HTTPS-only policy, which uses 302 redirects to force clients onto the secure version of any URL.
Internal links using HTTPS, so there is no redirection.
Some, but not all, external links from other domains use HTTPS. The rest do not and will of course be subject to the 302.
Google is only indexing the HTTPS version of each URL. Even if you search specifically for the HTTP URL, only the HTTPS URL is shown in the results.


Will there be any significant, immediate ranking benefit to changing our site to use 301 redirects to enforce HTTPS? Are there any statements from Google, Matt Cutts or other authorities on this specific situation?

Based on my research the difference should be minimal since we are already well indexed, and our internal links are fine, so Google is not going to apply a sitewide penalty for the 302s, which are, in effect, only the first link in the chain.
",Jordan Rieger,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/27841,"The problem with 302 redirects are that they are temporary, which often results in both pages being indexed in Google - The page you are redirecting from and the page you are redirecting to. If both pages are indexed in Google then that is problem as you have a duplicate page indexed.

As mentioned here: Google's page on HTTP status codes 


  302 (Moved temporarily). This code is similar to a 301 in that for a GET or HEAD request, it
  automatically forwards the requestor to a different location, but you
  shouldn't use it to tell the Googlebot that a page or site has moved
  because Googlebot will continue to crawl and index the original
  location.


So although you mention all your internal linking will use https, but external links inevitably will be with http, so Google is going to find some http links and 302 redirects, which could result in duplicate pages being indexed.

Here is video from Matt Cutts where he attempts to answer the question weather there are problems ranking sites that use https. Although he doesn't mention your question specifically, he does touch on the point that if doing this correctly, you should be using 301 redirects.

Can switching to HTTPS harm ranking? 

So to summarise you should not be using 302 redirects to force http, you should be using 301 redirects.

How ever, if the player looks down and tries to shoot (for example if an enemy is coming close) the bullet gets bounced off the collision body for the character.  Is it possible to make it so that my bullets can collide with everything except for the collision body?  Thanks!
",Anson Savage,https://blender.stackexchange.com/users/12805,"You can do this with collision mask and collision group.



These options are found in the physics panel. To fix your particular problem, select the invisible collision box for the player and put it in collision group 2. 

Next, select the bullet and while holding Shift click on the 2nd box in collision mask. This will stop the bullet from colliding with anything in collision group/layer 2.

you see if you change the text in the email text box it is removed from the obj unless it is a valid email...
",user1804318,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1804318,"It is not a bug, this is by design. The input type email uses regex to validate email address inputs. If the input is not valid it is removed from the model. 

On another note - if you wrap your stuff in a form - you can determine the validation state of the inputs. Also, as you are using a repeat, you will need an index. 

Here is an example of what I mean:

&lt;form name=""myForm""&gt;
    &lt;div ng-repeat=""contact in contacts""&gt;
      &lt;div ng-repeat=""email in contact.emails track by $index""&gt;
        &lt;div ng-show=""myForm.email{{$index}}.$invalid""&gt;Invalid email.&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;


I have updated your Plunker here.

These are the validation states you can use:

//[formName].[inputFieldName].property 
myForm.email1.$pristine;
// Boolean. True if the user has not yet modified the form.
myForm.email1.$dirty
// Boolean. True if the user has already modified the form.
myForm.email1.$valid
// Boolean.True if the the form passes the validation.
myForm.email1.$invalid
// Boolean. True if the the form doesn't pass the validation.

Rewards are definitely an incentive.  There is a reward in probably almost everything we choose to do in this life, and God certainly lets us know that He will give rewards for how we live here on earth (provided we trust Christ's atonement for our sins).

However, I can also seek eternal rewards with a corrupt heart, seeking to be seen and known as a spiritual person.  In that case, my reward is received here on earth by the acclaim I receive.  Matthew 6 speaks of this.  Giving is wonderful.  If you do it for God in secret, God rewards that.  If you give to the work of Christ and secretly harbor the desire to receive acclaim here on earth for it, then that is not commendable and would be considered a sin for having a heart attitude of pride.

5045,Another instructor is pushing me out of the classroom right after my class ends,"I am a graduate student in math in my final year, and for several years have been teaching at my department as a lecturer. This semester, in the same lecture hall there is another lecture that starts 20 minutes after my class ends. It's taught by another instructor from my department. I usually have many students coming to office hours and there are also students asking questions immediately after lecture. Due to other activities, I cannot have office hours right after the lecture this semester and can only stay for about 15 minutes to answer questions.

Many times in the past I had a similar situation and never had any issues with it. This semester the instructor who is teaching right after often arrives 20-15 minutes before her class starts and tells me immediately that I have to go with my students somewhere else. 

I make sure to leave the blackboard clean and take all my stuff away from the instructor's desk before she arrives, but I do believe that I have a right to stay in the classroom after my lecture for at least 5-10 minutes. There is no vacant classroom around, and I don't have time to go with students to my office, which is in a different building.

Last time the instructor told me in front of my students that I don't understand ""simple things"" and that I am ""playing games"". When I was talking to one of my students, she stood very close to us and clearly demonstrated that she wanted us out. I tried to explain her that I couldn't go anywhere else due to my time constraints, but she didn't want to listen to me. I really don't understand what ""simple"" things she meant and what ""games"" I am playing. 

We leave the board clean. She doesn't need to set up a projector. She can still talk to her students before her class starts, if she wants to (even though it seems like her students don't ask her any questions before their class). So, I don't see how I cause any disruption. 

I had met this woman many times before this semester, but we never talked. I didn't see her talking to other instructors/students much, and she seems to be quite reserved and a bit neurotic. She doesn't want to have any conversation with me regarding the issue.

I felt really offended after last class when she said those things to me in front of my students. What would you do in my case? 

Added later: There are no official rules regarding classroom occupancy between classes. Instructors are supposed to use common sense and be reasonable. For me using 50% of the break time seems reasonable to answer questions after lecture seems reasonable. I agree that for some people it may not.

I don't block the entrance to the classroom. A few students from the next class who come earlier always go ahead and take their seats as soon as my students start leaving the room. I also had one of the students from the next class listening to my explanation to one of those after-class questions and asking me further questions before their class (which is the same class as I am teaching, just a different section). Maybe the instructor got jealous, I don't know.

The entrance to the classroom is from its front (not back), so I do stay in the front. But it is a big lecture hall, and there is a plenty of space in front of the room (the board itself consists of 8 huge panels).

Also, during my career as a grad.student who is also teaching for the department, I have had several observations from experienced professors who are considered to be great teachers at the department and are in charge of undergraduate teaching policy. In my evaluations the fact that there are always several students approaching me with questions after class considered as very positive, meaning that students find me approachable. 

Thank you everyone for answers.

",Darjeeling,https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/2869,"There might be many reasons:

First, Senketsu was created specially for Ryuuko. This might have created link, that allows them to understand each other. It is clear that Senketsu doesn't really ""talk"" using his mouth. It is more like telepathy. This telepathic link might have been created either intentionally or accidentaly when Senketsu was made.

Second, there is question of relationships. Ryuuko and Senketsu are partners or friends. For them, it is symbiotic relationship. Satsuki on the other hand uses her willpower to dominate Junketsu so it can be used as a tool. And as such, there was no reason for her to listen to it, so even if Junketsu did talk, Satsuki would simply make it shut up, because Junketsu talking isn't what she need. Ryuuko and Senketsu were partners so it was obvious they would talk to each other.

And last is simply about production: The creators simply didn't think of Junketsu as character. And as such, they didn't give it any voice. Senketsu was individual character from early start and as such it made sense to make him talk. And as such, he helped character development of Ryuuko. Junketsu on the other side was just something used by Satsuki.

1844,Are human males and females more genetically different than members of other species?,"I'm looking at this Ted talk about a Saudi Arabia woman who dared to drive a car in the last few years. This reminds me that until the last century or so, women (all over the world?) enjoyed less rights and might've been pigeonholed into roles predetermined by society. Those roles might've encouraged certain traits, and discouraged others. Those who did not conform might've been punished, like the woman in the talk above received death threats and was jailed.

This sounds to me like selective pressure, did it really exist, and did it have any effect on the genetics/traits of modern women?

This makes me interested in the question - compared to other species, are men and women more genetically different because of selective pressure put on women to conform to male-dominated world for thousands of years before 19th century?
",Alex Stone,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/577,"Essentially, what makes a (mammalian) man a man is a small region on the Y-chromosome called SRY. If this region is deleted, a female phenotype having XY-chromosomes develops. If this region is translocated to an X-chromosome, a male phenotype with two X-chromosomes develops.

2339,Where to find ferry flights and empty leg flights?,"Based on this question Avoiding crew fatigue on empty leg flights I learned that there are ""empty leg"" flights or ""ferry flights"".

These seem a good option but I would like to know more about them.

Where are these announced? How can one travel this way?
",nsn,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/3736,"Private Aircraft

Others have answered for the commercial and chartered sectors, which is increasingly being strangled due to regulation.  This answer will focus on the private sector.  

Where are these announced? 

The short answer is they are not announced, at least publicly like on a web site. Any kind of advertising or public communication kicks them into the charter or commercial spheres. When you know that a private pilot is planning to fly, you can ask if he wants to take you along.  It's that simple.  

Meeting people and making personal contact replaces the internet.  I think it's OK to exchange emails with somebody who already knows you and met you personally or through a club, but they are not going to warm up to somebody out of the blue.  Also in terms of 'where are these announced', some discretion can be in order. If you go around identifying your contacts by name on your Facebook page, it may not be appreciated and you're likely to find your emails unanswered after that.

If you know something is on a pilot's bucket list, like flying a Nanchang CJ-6 (a vintage two seater on many dream bucket lists), you can keep your eyes open for that kind of opportunity.  Whatever gets you talking to pilots and in the air is key towards empty leg travel.

Another example...  In 2018, there will be a competition to fly around the world in Bristol Bulldogs.  For people who live on the route and are aware that Bulldogs need to land for maintenance and fuel at the drop of a hat, there's an opportunity to offer some hospitality and a quick tour of your city. 

A really great calling card is the ability to speak different languages and to let people know you're happy to translate.  I have also done pet-sitting, baby-sitting, driving, tour guiding, and cabin clean up/dish-washing.  Having multiple passports also gives you a slight edge because you don't face visa issues. 

How can one travel this way?

Some important things to point out about this...


Timing.  If you haven't done it before, it's not going to happen overnight unless you're very lucky. It takes a long time to get oriented and to establish yourself as an enthusiast. 
Flexibility. You don't always go exactly when you want and where you want. Instead, you go where the pilot is going and that may leave you with additional transportation to reach your destination - or even stranded for a while.  For example, a flight into Heathrow or Gatwick would be extraordinarily rare; the general case is  they are headed for a private airport like Cotswold or even as far out as Humberside.  There are about 20  - 25 airports in the greater London area and home counties, but not every type of plane is cleared for their type of strip(s).  On the plus side and if you are younger, being 'stranded' at some random field gives the opportunity to hang around the terminal and meet pilots who might be flying to some place else (note: I never went 'total gypsy' myself, but have spoken with people who managed to hop respectable distances over the course of say, a year; others have found that the demands of being flexible became unpleasant as they got older). 
Regulations.  It's getting worse and worse.  Airpooler is now moribund because of US regulations.  BlackJet was supposed to have Uber's business model, but now appears to be offering very expensive pay-only arrangements to avoid being shut down.  And the EU has jumped in with stricter interpretation of Regulation 965/2014, which is making some pilots reluctant to do anything at all unless they know you well. 


How to learn more about it?  In comments, you wrote you're looking to know more about it...

The best way to find out more is to join local aviation clubs and read aviation magazines oriented to private pilots.  A simple Google search 'aviation clubs near London' returned two pages of results.  I am in two for example.    



Source: Club event at Rochester Airport, Kent, fair use

For aviation magazines, I can suggest ""Pilot Getaways"" (mostly US audience), ""Pilot Magazine (UK version)"" (UK general interest), ""Plane and Pilot"", (US, mixes private and business, more technical).

Some other helpful entry points...


You can attend events and festivals, like the annual one at Shobdon Field where anybody can go and enjoy the event while expressing enthusiasm for the sport.
You can be a volunteer in Project Orbis, or raise donations in a challenge event.  The Corporate Angel Network also takes in volunteers for data entry (with no direct path to flying) but leading to a wealth of knowledge about flight schedules, pilots, fractional owners, private car operators, airports, and all the rest.  
Check out newly converted or upgraded airports like Conington. Check out their engineering and repair facilities, what kinds of certifications they offer. Even Wifi and broadband. It's all useful knowledge.


Finally, having some kit, like a Delorme Communicator or a Zulu class headset can be a tremendous help. Certainly the pilot will have his own, but it helps to establish you as a serious enthusiast who uses his own stuff.

2365,What creates this strange flare and how to prevent it?,"I shot at a concert for the first time. The pictures were pretty good for the capability of my equipment, but on some shots, the light has a very strange flare. It isn't the usual rays, but some soft, non-symmetric form which I find quite strange, and, on most shots, distracting. 



On this image, you can see it just above Gino's head and also behind his back, to the right of the mic stand. I am not sure if the slight blue lines on the left side of the picture (they form a triangle aimed at Chris's head, maybe not visible on all monitors) are part of the problem or if they come from a different light source. 

What makes them appear, and how do I avoid them? 

I shot with a D90 with a 18-200 lens, no filters or hoods attached. The settings were quite strained (iso 3200, often at max length and max aperture for the length. This specific picture is 1/125, f 5.3, 95 mm).

Then it's just flare caused by shooting into a lightsource. Concert lights tend to produce strong flaring effects as they are very focussed.

The only fix is to use a different lens (they all flare differently) or not shoot directly into any lightsources. However when I'm shooting concerts I usually shoot directly into the lights on purpose and use any flare as an artistic tool to make the image more interesting.

To get the ""popup"" window to show, so you can answer a question in the survey, you need to press a button which calls this script:

So, is it possible to somehow combine the page + the javascript, so all they have to do is press one link or alternatively, a hyperlink which goes to a file on a server which triggers all this, so they instantly get to the page + the javascript automatically pops so they dont have to press the button?

Keep in mind, when I say ""hyperlink"" I mean the kind of hyperlink you would see in an email. A simple link to a website or a server location.

I'm not very good at everything that has to do with programming and webdesign, but I do have access to the sharepoint, though I'd need serious guiding in how to add anything there other than simple webparts. It's SharePoint Server 2010.

  equipment, to equipment grounding conductor(s), or be reconnected to
  ground on the load side of the service disconnecting means except as
  otherwise permitted in this article.


Which means the only place the ""neutral"" (grounded conductor) is bonded, is in the main service panel.  If the grounded (neutral) and equipment grounding conductors (EGC) are bonded anywhere else, you can end up with neutral currents on the EGC and metal parts of equipment which is a violation of 250.6(A).

  that will prevent objectionable current.




A second look

After taking another look at this, he could mean that the white insulated wires are not marked appropriately.  When you use a wire with white (gray, or with three continuous white stripes) insulation as an ungrounded (hot) conductor, you have to mark the wire in some way to indicate that it is not used as a grounded (neutral) conductor.  


  200.7 Use of Insulation of a White or Gray Color or with Three Continuous White Stripes.
  
  (C) Circuits of 50 Volts or More. The use of insulation that is white or gray or that has three continuous white stripes for other
  than a grounded conductor for circuits of 50 volts or more shall be
  permitted only as in (1) through (3).
  
  (1) If part of a cable assembly and where the insulation is
  permanently reidentified to indicate its use as an ungrounded
  conductor, by painting or other effective means at its termination,
  and at each location where the conductor is visible and accessible.

Since the white wires connected to the breakers are not marked, it looks (to the untrained eye) as if the grounded (neutral) conductors are connected to the hot bus. The most common way to mark the wires, is to wrap a bit of black electrical tape around a small section of the wire.

1683,How was this photo taken,"My question is how was this picture taken.
And I've got a few assumptions I made regarding the photo, please correct me when I am wrong.


Low aperture value, like 1.4-2.0
Quite high shutter speed, my guess is that it was 400-500
Auto iso speed


That's how I would have taken a picture like this. The other thing is that it has some vignetting - I guess, it's a postprocessing.
What else? It looks to me that some other postprocessing had to be done.

And what kind of lens you think it was?
My guess is that it was some zoom-lens, but that's all I can tell.


",Anders D,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/21963,"This is mostly guess-work:

To me this looks like a medium length zoom:


(Assuming its on a Full Frame body) of 150mm - 200mm.
Shutter speed would be 1/200th+
ISO 800 (I NEVER use Auto ISO)
Aperture may not be that large, as the lens is long-ish, could be 3.5f ish

",sivakumar,https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/5373,"A class can be declared as abstract for 2 reasons.  


It contains abstract methods
That class should not be instantiated.  


In magento's case most of the abstract classes fall in the second case.
Classes like Mage_Catalog_Model_Abstract and Mage_Core_Model_Abstract are never instantiated. They are just used as a common ancestor for other classes.
Just search in the code for extends Mage_Core_Model_Abstract.  

The ""abstract"" classes contain common behavior of all child classes but they don't actually do something without some configuration values.  

Let's take for example Mage_Core_Model_Abstract. This is a common model for all other models that map to one table (or more tables for the eav entities).  But the base class should never be instantiated.
For example you can call $model-&gt;save() on a child class because that one has a mapping to (at least) a table but you cannot call it on the abstract class. But the save method works the same for all the child models so no need to implement it in all the child classes.  

I hope I was clear enough.

Yes, those close knew well that Palpatine was a Sith, but to much of the general public, those were just stories and rumors of a far away place that had very little to do with them.  What happens in the capital isn't their problem or their concern.  And people say all kinds of different things about far away people and places.  Who's to say what's true and what isn't?

In the end, Sith or not, Palpatine is still a politician and realizes that as long as most of the people think things are relatively the same as always, then far fewer of them will openly rebel against the order of things.  So there's more soldiers about?  Just means better security and less crime to the people.  And for that, they're willing to dismiss a great deal as rumor and speculation by those who don't care for the status quo.

But people still knew what the Sith were from legends and wars of the past.  Were he to openly declare himself in a way that validated it to the public at large, there would be far more rebellion than just the Alliance's small force.  So by maintaining the public perception that he was just Emperor Palpatine, more of the public will keep in line.  It's all about the show.

Do not listen to advice that recommends sending the email directly from trigger (eg. using SQLCLR). Beside the obvious performance hit (every DML operation on the table now has to wait for the huge latency of a SMTP or HTTP operation) you have the much bigger problem of transactional consistency, how do you recall the email on rollback? So yes, using an intermediate queue is mandatory. Also have a look at Using Tables as Queues.

5193,How does Christianity deal with biblical criticism related to the Old Testament?,"As an orthodox Jew I have seen quite a stir lately regarding the topic of biblical criticism, specifically towards the Old Testament (Torah). 

I have perused several questions in this stack which seem to address this topic in general, and learned a lot about apologetics, but I have not seen answers that address some of the major claims of biblical criticism, especially as it pertains to the Old Testament. 

For example:


The story of Noah and the flood seems to be contradicted by archaeological evidence as well as having been 'borrowed' from earlier flood narratives such as the Gilgamesh story
Many of the portions of the Old Testament seem to be borrowed from earlier near eastern texts such as the Hammurabi code 
The notion that there are multiple authors (documentary hypothesis) of the Old Testament.


In short, how does Christianity deal with some of the major contentions of biblical criticism towards the Old Testament?



I apologize if any parts of my question offend any sensibilities to which I am unaware. 
",user5796,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/5796,"Christians are very diverse on how they handle this type of criticism. Probably the most visible school of thought in today's media are the literalists. These Christians accept that the Bible was fully authored by God and is complete and infallible. For them, Gilgamesh is either fiction or a pagan account of the Genesis story. Hammurabi's code is a set of inferior pagan laws.

The most liberal Christians treat the Bible as one of many worthwhile ancient writings and as a product of the sharing of knowledge across cultures. The Genesis account was inspired by Gilgamesh. Mosaic Law and Hammurabi's Code may have been derived from the same source.

Most Christians fall somewhere in between the two. The Bible wasn't written in a vacuum and it's just a matter of course that there are similarities to other writings from other cultures. It doesn't change the Bible's supremacy and it doesn't impact their faith. An explanation I heard from a conservative reform Jew fits nicely. God spoke to lots of people. The Jews were just the ones who heard and obeyed.

That there were multiple authors of the Bible is just a given. Even the most conservative literalists believe that God used many people to write His word. Different groups might disagree on how many authors there were, but there was definitely more than one.

Can someone with a better understanding of the physics involved clarify this for me.  I've never seen this concept explicitly mentioned anywhere, so I am a bit suspect of it.
",Sean,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/1480,"There is no ""focal length multiplier effect"", period.
The focal length of the lens does NOT change magically because you use a smaller or larger sensor, it stays exactly the same.

All you get is an image that's cropped from the one you would have gotten had you used the same lens to record an image on a larger size sensor.
The DOF will thus be the same it would have been had you used that larger sensor as well.

",Yossi Gil,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/3391,"The MWE example presented contains some conceptual errors.

The most relevant one, I think, is that you wish to reference nodes through their text and not through their name. That's what I read in:

\node(a)  [draw,rectangle,text=teal] at (0,0) {here};
\node(b)  [draw,rectangle,text=olive] at (3,0) {there};
\path[measuring south=from here to there is far,fill=red];


The \path syntax should contain a and b, not here and there.

Second, here the late options are used in the wrong manner: once the path is ended, that's it, you can't append stuff anymore. So, in measuring south you are willing to insert path rather than append after command. Moreover, since you are changing path options from the main path to the inserted ones, you may want to use \pgfextra.

This would have been my way to go:

4258,How does Charlie deduce Myra is Mrs Kieslowski?,"In Seven Psychopaths Charlie (Woody Harrelson) comes to the hospital to find Mrs Kieslowski. He finds a patient- who we know is Myra Kieslowski- but wrongly assumes that because she is black it cannot be her. He then tells her how he is looking for Mrs Kieslowski because her husband has stolen his dog.

In the course of the subsequent conversation, he comes to realise that she is the woman he's looking for. But I can't understand how.

Here's the discussion between Charlie and Moyra.


  Myra: I'm sure Mr. Kieslowski will take good care of your dog and get
  it back to you safe. He always seems like a sweet man when he comes
  in.
  
  Charlie: He come visit her a lot?
  
  Myra: Every day-
  
  Charlie: What kind of times every day?
  
  Myra: Different times, you know. And not every day. He misses a day
  now and then.
  
  Charlie: Oh. yeah? He been in today?
  
  Myra: Yeah. He came in earlier this morning, about 10:00 or so.
  
  Charlie: So the Polack married a n*gger, huh?


How did Charlie deduce this, from the conversation? 

Was it just the fact that Myra seemed too eager to convince him that Charlie had already missed Mr Kieslowski's visit and was wasting his time waiting? In which case, why did she say he visited every day? 
",Urbycoz,https://movies.stackexchange.com/users/4573,"The dialogue you cite actually comes after Myra sees Hans through her window and after she already talked a little bit with Charlie about Mrs Kieslowski. She was quite sure she could drag the whole situation out a bit, just playing her roommate and waiting what happens. But once she saw Hans walking to the hospital to visit her, she became increasingly nervous, knowing that Charlie was looking for him and the time ran short.

And nervous as she got, she suddenly brought the conversation to Mr. Kieslowski herself, which is where your quoted dialogue starts. And I think this is exactly the point where Charlie at least starts to get suspicious about her. I think this can be perceived in his behaviour, since after she said that, he suddenly starts to stop his little playing around with the wheelchair he sits in and turns around to look straight at her, getting nearer and nearer to her. And at this point he starts to interrogate her a bit more about Mr Kieslowski and his visiting times. Maybe he already guessed it at this point or he just had a suspicion. But it surely didn't help Myra that she got increasingly nervous and started beating around the bush with stuff like ""Different times, you know, not every day"" (after previously saying a pretty definite ""Every day"").

So to sum up, I would say at the point Myra brought the conversation to Mr Kieslowki (so at the start of your quoted dialogue section) Charlie definitely got suspicous about her and his supicion was manifested by her nervous behaviour during the further conversation. Maybe he even wasn't 100% sure before his ""n--ger"" comment. But he was at least sufficiently sure enough and Myra certainly didn't deny it.

#Hotlink protection (only for www.domain.it cause http://domain.it is being redirected)
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.domain.it/.*$      [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.domain.it$      [NC]
RewriteRule .*\.(wav|swf|jpg|jpeg|gif|png|bmp|js)$ - [F,NC]


This works well, but I recently dicovered that when I ask for http://www.domain.com/somepage.htm/ (with final slash) the hotlink protection seems to be triggered and server stops page to download .(wav|swf|jpg|jpeg|gif|png|bmp|js) files

Do you know how could I fix this in .htaccess???

Before today I even thought that the server should return an error if I enter as URL http://www.domain.com/somepage.htm/ (with final slash). But I saw it's normal because if you look for http://www.php.net/docs.php it returns the same page of http://www.php.net/docs.php/ (final slash).

",Marco Demaio,https://serverfault.com/users/34721,"Are you sure it's the hotlink protection?  If your website is laid out something like this:

/somepage.htm
/images/a.jpg


Then if somepage.htm has relative paths to the image like &lt;img src=""images/a.jpg""&gt; and you go to http://example.com/somepage.htm/, then your web browser will think it's in the ""somepage.htm"" directory and try to load the image http://example.com/somepage.htm/images/a.jpg.  Apache will probably send you another copy of somepage.htm if you go there, which will cause your browser to show a broken image.

I'm not sure if Apache has a setting to turn this off.   It doesn't make much sense on plain HTML files but the reason Apache (and other servers) allow this is for sites that use ""pretty URLs"" (like serverfault's URLs!) where the URL extends past the actual file.

",Mandar,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/3774,"The fact that you got notice doesn't necessarily mean that you should have filed. What it means is that the IRS thought that you should file. They're expecting your tax return, and I suspect it is because you made a mistake.

There are several different mistakes that you could have made (the list below is not complete, just what came to my mind right now):


You filed 2010 return as a resident (form 1040) instead of non-resident (1040NR) that you should have. IRS expects you to continue filing as resident, or to notify them of termination of residency. But since you've been on a student (J/F) visa - you were not a resident to begin with.
You filed form W9 with your bank or your clients. Form W9 is for residents, so they report your income to the IRS as if you were a resident. Hence the IRS expectation of a tax return. What you should have filed with them was form W8-BEN or W8-ECI, to show your non-resident status.
You received interest on your BofA bank account and didn't report it to the IRS, while they did. This is a matching error. Even if you're not supposed to pay tax, you should file tax returns in these cases to avoid these notices. However, if that's the case, you should have also paid some tax (check the treaty).
Your client issued a W2 for you. If that happened - it could really mess you up in the US, so I hope its not the case.


I suggest you take it to a US-licensed tax preparer (EA or CPA) who can check what exactly that is that the IRS want from you, why, and how to resolve it.

I lose 900ft in elevation on steep grades with lots of stop signs and traffic lights. On top of that, it rains a decent amount and the rim brakes are terrible in that weather. I don't trust them downhill in the rain. Sometimes I just walk.

I feather the brakes going downhill, because otherwise I'm too fast to stop quickly for an errant car.

",ash,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/14519,"There are several solutions:

(1) Switch your brake pads - a harder compound will wear less, but be less effective at braking. Make sure to clean your rims for rim brakes as well.

  What should I do when Ubuntu freezes?  




I've just tried to install ubuntu 12.04 dual boot OS with Windows 7 and it finished installing in ubuntu. However, it said that the bootloader ""grub.."" failed to install. The same exact problem here I receive the error &#39;grub-install /dev/sda failed&#39; while attempting to install Ubuntu as the computer&#39;s only OS. . When I tried to restart my computer, it went to the hp screen since my computer is a dv6 hp laptop and then it goes into this black screen with no words or any buttons will work. There is just a blinking underscore that seems like it'll allow me to type but makes error sounds when I type. Is this because I possibly partitioned my memory incorrectly? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm very desperate. ANY HELP would be great. Thanks.

UPDATE:

I gave up and just reformatted my whole comp. I'm sure there was a better way to do it by either booting it up by the live usb with the ubuntu OS and try to reinstall grub loader. 
",Chris,https://askubuntu.com/users/96163,"I believe I've been plagued with your problem once or twice before. Make sure that your BIOS is set to use the optical or thumb drive first.

Insert your Ubuntu disk else Windows disk and recover. Note that Windows does not see Ubuntu drives natively at all.  If none of this works for you then try another Hard drive but make sure to disconnect the one you cannot boot from.  Install. Now install the other drive as a slave and BIOS to make sure your computer boots off the disk you just installed the OS to.

In Paris, there's an excellent co-working space La Cantine (as mentioned in this question). Regus have an office by the station which includes a business lounge, which in theory ought to be all I need. Unfortunately, the time I tried going there, it was very noisy with lots of people having meetings there (which I've not really found elsewhere), and the wifi was so bad you longed for when an IDBus would park outside so you could use theirs...

Are there any good co-working spaces that'd welcome a visiting tourist for half a day or a day? (Googling found places with a 1+week minimum commitment, which aren't really suitable for me as a tourist just wanting something like half a day or a day). Or failing that, are there any good places (cafes/libraries/etc) I could look at going to?

4874,Lychrel calculator (Project Euler 55),"
  If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
  
  Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,

349 + 943 = 1292,
1292 + 2921 = 4213
4213 + 3124 = 7337

  
  That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
  
  Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers,
  like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a
  palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel
  number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the
  purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel
  until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every
  number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in
  less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing
  power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In
  fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty
  iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664
  (53 iterations, 28-digits).
  
  Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves
  Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.
  
  How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?


This is my solution:

from datetime import datetime

candidates = []

def reverse(number):
    ''' Returns the reverse order of an integer,
        for example: reverse(123) returns the integer 321 '''
    number = str(number)
    return int(number[::-1])

def is_lychrel(number):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is a lychrel candidate,
        but works only with numbers from 1 to 10000 '''
    iterated = number + reverse(number)
    for i in range(25):
        rev_iterated = reverse(iterated)
        if iterated != rev_iterated:
            iterated = iterated + rev_iterated
        else:
            return False
    return True

if __name__ == '__main__':

    start_time = datetime.now()

    for number in range(10001):
        if is_lychrel(number):
            candidates.append(number)

    time = datetime.now() - start_time # To get the time of the calculation

    print('In {} were found {} lychrel candidates'.format(time, len(candidates)))
    print(' '.join(map(str, candidates)), 'are candidates.')
    suml = input('Press ENTER to close ')


On my PC (with Intel Atom 2GHz), I got it with .4 seconds.  Could you offer suggestions on making it run faster?
",matheussilvapb,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/37913,"1. Comments on your code


Python has a built-in module, timeit, for measuring the execution time of small code snippets. So there is no need for all that fussing about with datetime.
Project Euler problem 55 says:


  you are given that for every number below ten thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations


but your code only tries 25 iterations. It happens to be the case that 25 iterations are enough in this case, but how did you figure that out? If you had a mathematical proof that showed that 25 iterations were enough, then that would be fair enough, but I suspect that in fact you re-ran the program with different values for the count of iterations until you found that smallest one that produces the right answer. This seems like cheating to me: if you are willing to do that, why not just replace the whole program with:

print(answer)


which would be even faster?
The problem statement asks:


  How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?


but you test range(10001) which is off by one. Luckily for you, 10,000 is not a Lychrel number, so this doesn't lead to an error.
You've made candidates into a global variable, and run some of your code at top level. This makes it hard to test your program from the interactive interpreter. You need something like this:

def problem55(n):
    """"""Return a list of Lychrel candidates below n.""""""
    candidates = []
    for number in range(n):
        if is_lychrel(number):
            candidates.append(number)
    return candidates


and then you can test it like this:

&gt;&gt;&gt; from timeit import timeit
&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(lambda:problem55(10000), number=100)
8.279778157011606



2. Speeding it up


The problem statement only asks how many Lychrel numbers there are, so there is no need to construct a list of them.
Function calls in Python are moderately expensive, so you can save some time by inlining them. This leads to an implementation like this:

def problem55_1(n, m):
    """"""Return the count of numbers below n that do not lead to a
    palindrome after m iterations of reversal and addition.

    """"""
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        r = int(str(i)[::-1])
        for _ in range(m):
            i += r
            r = int(str(i)[::-1])
            if i == r:
                break
        else:
            count += 1
    return count


which is about 16% faster than yours:

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(lambda:problem55_1(10000, 50), number=100)
6.93482669594232

Janne suggested that you could speed things up by caching the numbers already found to be Lychrel and non-Lychrel, and you replied:


  doing that is going to require more conditions and probably is going to be the same running time or even worse


which is a bit of a defeatist attitude. Certainly the code gets more complex when you add caching, but it's not a priori obvious whether this costs more than it saves, or saves more than it costs. The best way to find out is to knuckle down and try it:

def problem55_2(n, m):
    """"""Return the count of numbers below n that do not lead to a
    palindrome after m iterations of reversal and addition.

    """"""
    lychrel = set()
    nonlychrel = set()
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        j = i
        if i in lychrel:
            count += 1
            continue
        stack = [i]
        r = int(str(i)[::-1])
        for _ in range(m):
            i += r
            if i in lychrel:
                count += 1
                lychrel.update(stack)
                break
            if i in nonlychrel:
                nonlychrel.update(stack)
                break
            stack.append(i)
            r = int(str(i)[::-1])
            if i == r:
                nonlychrel.update(stack)
                break
        else:
            count += 1
            lychrel.update(stack)
    return count


I find that this is about twice as fast as your code:

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(lambda:problem55_2(10000, 50), number=100)
3.935654202941805

One final tweak from me. Now that we are caching, the order in which we check numbers for the Lychrel property matters. As you iterate the reverse-and-add process, the numbers get bigger. So if we start with the larger numbers and proceed downwards, then we are more likely to get cache hits. So I tried replacing the line:

    for i in range(n):


with

    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):


and got a further small speedup:

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(lambda:problem55_3(10000, 50), number=100)

6265,Oracle.DataAccess.Client.BulkCopy - trying to cast varchar2 as number when it shouldn't,"I have a table (A)  that includes a column named confirmation_number.  It is defined as a varchar2(30) and contains something like SMITERI-2012-02-31-4567.

I have another table (B) that also includes a column named confirmation_number, and it is also a varchar2(30).

I have a stored procedure that extracts the data from A, performing some transformation on it, and it includes the confirmation number column.  

I use C# and ODP.Net to run the stored procedure and load a DataTable with it.  I then perform some additional transformations.  However, I never touch the confirmation number column.

Finally, I create an OracleBulkCopy object, set the column mappings, tell it to update Table B, and call loader.WriteToServer(dataTable).

I am getting the following error:

Input string was not in a correct format.
   at System.Number.StringToNumber(String str, NumberStyles options, NumberBuffer&amp; number, NumberFormatInfo info, Boolean parseDecimal)
   at System.Number.ParseInt64(String value, NumberStyles options, NumberFormatInfo numfmt)
   at Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleBulkCopy.PerformBulkCopy()


I have confirmed that the error occurs on the confirmation_number column, because if I don't load that column, the dataload succeeds.

Any ideas why the BulkCopy would be trying to turn a varchar(2) into a Number?

EDIT:
I have confirmed the following relevant issues:


This is happening on more than just the confirmation number.  This
appears to only be a problem on string columns - whether from a
string to a string or a string to an integer. 
This doesn't happen on every varchar2 column - last name and first name have no trouble.
This happens both on columns that have no null values (confirmation
number) and on columns that may have null values (street type).
Investigating the contents of the datatable at the moment before the
loader begins shows no difference in column definition between those
that successfully go in and those that do not.


I'm beginning to wonder if there's a bug in the BulkCopy itself and if I need to do this load using another utility.

4342,What's the base f-stop when counting an ideal f-stop for lens?,"I've read a lot around this site that an ideal quality of the lens is achieved when using f-stop roughly 2 stops slower than the fastest value of the lens.

Firstly, I'm not exactly sure what ""2 stops"" mean when it comes to f-stop, but this isn't really important in what I'm about to ask. What I'd like to know is what is the base f-stop when counting this value.

Let's look at it this way: If I have a prime lens with f/1.8, then obviously I'll be getting the ideal value from f/1.8, let's say after 2 stops I get f/2.8?

But! What in case of zoom lenses, for example 18-55, which have f-stop f/3.5 - f/5.6. Should I take f/5.6 as my base value, or does the base value depends on the real fastest value at the exact focal length?

Therefore, if I set the lens to 18 mm, their fastest aperture is f/3.5 and thus the ideal quality is at f/5.6 and when I set it to 55 mm, their fastest aperture is f/5.6 and thus the ideal quality is at f/8 ? Or is it f/8 for the whole focal range ?
",Richard Rodriguez,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/4822,"Real fastest value at the exact focal length.

But, this is just a rule of thumb — it's not necessarily exactly two stops in every case.

For the question of what two stops mean, see What does f-stop mean?. In short, each stop is approximately the-square-root-of-two times the previous one. That means half the light is allowed in (which is why the seemingly-weird series of numbers was chosen). Two stops is doing that twice, which conveniently works out to simply being doubling. Two stops from f/2 is f/4, and and two stops from that is f/8. Or, starting at f/1.8, two stops is f/3.6.

The test results comparison tool used by Digital Photography Review is interesting for looking at this. Try this test of Pentax's 18-55mm zoom, which like most kit zooms goes from f/3.5 at the short end to f/5.6 zoomed out.

You can see that at 18mm, the sharpness improves as you go from f/3.5 to f/4 to f/5.6. At f/8, it's more even from center to corners, but doesn't get any sharper. And beyond that, it drops off.

Then, change the focal length to 55mm. You'll notice that with this lens, overall sharpness goes down from 18mm at f/5.6. At f/8, it picks up a little bit, and a little more at f/11, and then back down again at f/16.

So, that fits with the two-stops guideline pretty well. Same for the Canon kit lens, and Nikon too.

With the Pentax DA 15mm f/4 Limited test, they've got test results in third-stops, and there you can see that f/7.1 is no better than f/6.3, and f/8 is worse — so that's only 1⅓ stops. On the other hand the DA★ 55mm f/1.4 shows peak sharpness at f/4.5 — closed down by 3⅓ stops. This doesn't reflect a problem with the lens, just different priorities in design. The Nikon 50mm f/1.4G is similar, with peak sharpness at 3⅔ or 4 stops down. However, the entry level Nikkor f/1.8G fits the ""two stops"" guide quite well, peaking at around f/3.5.

It's also worth noting that this test is primarily concerned with sharpness, because that's easy to measure. Other image quality and rendering characteristics are also affected. Vignetting (light falloff in the corners) gets better the more you stop down, and it's usually gone after two stops. And bokeh quality is usually improved by stopping down, too — generally, lens bokeh is nicer/smoother stopped down a bit, but of course it's less visible since you have greater depth of field. Plus, shape of the aperture blades will become visible in specular highlights, which is a side-effect unrelated to stopping down per se — some modern lenses have rounded aperture blades to make that not be a concern.

481,Why is this type of hesitation considered unethical?,"In two previous questions, it was clearly agreed that hesitating before playing a singleton specifically, and hesitating during play as a bluff generally constitute ""wrongful/unethical hesitation."" As an advanced beginner, I don't understand this rule at all.

I know that at the highest level, the best way to play and not give away any information about your holding to the opponents is to play each card at a nice even tempo. I am not a world class player; I am not even an advanced player (if I endplay you, I promise it wasn't intentional). As such, I frequently need to pause and calculate what to play, even in situations where the correct play should be obvious. 

Knowing that I will inevitably need to pause and consider a play and that that pause will provide my opponents with the information that I had a potentially difficult decision to make, why is it considered unethical for me to occasionally insert a similar pause before a routine play?

It isn't as if I could use such a pause to reliably signal something to my partner. In fact, this strategy removes the temptation for partner to draw unauthorized inferences from my pauses.

9317,"If you attempt to predict a Roulette wheel $n$ times, what's the probability you'll get $5$ in a row at some point?","I'm talking about a Roulette wheel with $38$ equally probable outcomes. Someone mentioned that he guessed the correct number five times in a row, and said that this was surprising because the probability of this happening was $$\left(\frac{1}{38}\right)^5$$

This is true if you only play the game $5$ times. However, if you play it more than $5$ times there's a higher (should be much higher?) probability that you'll get $5$ in a row at some point. 

I was thinking about how surprised this person should be at their streak of $m$ correct guesses given that they play $n$ games, each with probability $p$ of success. It makes intuitive sense that their surprise should be proportional to $1/q$ (or maybe $\log(1/q)$ since $1$ in a billion doesn't surprise you $10$ times more than $1$ in $100$ million), where $q$ is the probability that they get at least one streak of $m$ correct guesses at some point in their $n$ games. 

So, with the Roulette example I was thinking about, $p=1/38$ and $m=5$. 

I tried to find an explicit formula for $q$ in terms of $n$, and encountered some difficulty, because of the non-independence of ""getting a streak in the first five tries"" and ""getting a streak in tries $2$ through $6$"" (if the first is a failure, it's much more  likely that the second will be too). 



In summary, two questions:


How do I find the probability that you get $5$ correct guesses in a row at some point if you play $n$ games of Roulette?
More generally, what is the probability that you get $m$ successes at some point in a series of $n$ events, each with probability $p$ of success? 


The variables satisfy $\,\,\,m,n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\,\,\,m\leq n$, $\,\,\,p \in \mathbb{R}$, $\,\,\,0 \leq p \leq 1$.



If we write the answer to the second question as a function $q(m,n,p)$, then we can say that $q$ should be increasing with $n$, decreasing with $m$, and increasing with $p$. It should equal $p^n$ when $m=n$ and should equal $1$ when $p=1$ and $0$ when $p=0$. 

I feel as though this should be a basic probability problem, but I'm having trouble solving it. Maybe some kind of recursive approach would work? Given $q(n,m,p)$, I think I could write $q(n+1,m,p)$ using the probability that the last $m-1$ results are all successes ...
",Zubin Mukerjee,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/111946,"To answer your general question, if the events are independent then the probability of getting only $m$ successes at a row once is $$(n-m+1)p^m(1-p)^{n-m}$$ This is because one can have success $m$ times at a row out of $n$ plays in $n-m+1$ ways and in each of these events have a probability $p^m$ of happening and the failures then happen in the rest of the $n-m$ cases with probability $(1-p)^{n-m}$. 

EDIT: As I understand now my previous answer does not correctly address the question. Now, let $P(m,n)$ denote the required probability which is of getting $m$ or more consecutive successes in a series of $n$ independent events. Then, basically we want the event that the first time $m&gt;1$ consecutive successes occur. Now, let $R_k(m,n)$ denotes the probability that $m$ consecutive successes happen for the first time at $n\ge k&gt; m$ th trail. Then we have $$R_k(m,n)=qR_{k-1}(m,n-1)+pqR_{k-2}(m,n-2)+p^2qR_{k-3}(m,n-3)+\cdots+p^{m-1}qR_{k-m}(m,n-m)$$ with $R_1(m,n)=\cdots=R_{m-1}(m,n)=0,R_{m}(m,n)=p^m$ where $q=1-p$. Now, the probability $R_{k}(m,n)$ should not depend upon the second argument as long as $k\le n$. Then calling only $R_{k}$, and defining $r=[R_1\cdots R_n]^T$, we have the equation $$R_k=qR_{k-1}+pqR_{k-2}+\cdots+qp^{m-1}R_{k-m}$$ which can be solved by solving the equation $$x^m-qx^{m-1}-\cdots-qp^{m-2}x-qp^{m-1}=0$$ to get $R_k=\sum_{i=1}^m a_i \lambda_i^k$ where $\lambda_i$ are the roots of the last equation and the coefficients $a_i$ can be obtained from the initial conditions. Then, we have $$P(n,m)=\sum_{k=n-m}^n R_k=\sum_{i=0}^m a_i \frac{\lambda_i^{n-m}(1-\lambda_i^{m+1})}{1-\lambda_i}$$

Therefore, Vector(W) above would become:

Vector(W) = dist(A,B) * unitVector(W)


Leading to the equation proposed by the author.

Please let me know if this is clear enough.

",Enda Farrell,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/111532,"What I typically do is mount the USB drive in an isolated virtual machine. But this requires you have a hypervisor installed and a guest operation system configured, etc. This works because I can snapshot the VM state as well as isolate at the network level. But it's too complicated to explain here.

Probably the easiest way to do this is to mount the drive as read-only. You can do this by using diskutil from Terminal.


Open /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.
Insert the drive into a USB port.
Run diskutil list from Terminal and note the disk number for your USB drive. Here's what my output looked like



  $ diskutil list

So my USB drive is disk2.


Eject the disk by running diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX (which would be ""disk2"" for me)
Remount disk in read only mode by running diskutil mountDisk readOnly /dev/diskX
Use Finder or Terminal to examine the disk.


Note that if you eject the drive, you'd need to run this sequence again to have it mount as read only. There are other apps that automate mounting disks as read only but the command line is the only real UI for any OS! ;-) #opinion

The edit view already has a Cancel exit mechanism (default for all our edit forms) and it has a save button (which both saves and exits back to the list).

Should the Save button be disabled until changes are made to any of the details?
",Erics,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/8207,"In an app I created some 10 years ago, disabling is the approach I took. Each form has a Save, Cancel and Close button. Save and Cancel are both disabled until changes have been made. Close is always available and will prompt to save or cancel when changes were made.

At the time I thought it was the right way to do things. Now, every time I open an edit form and want it to go away, it irks me that I have to use close and can't just use ok or cancel.

I think the form should figure out what to do: 


ok + changes => save
ok + no changes => close
cancel + changes => close
cancel + no changes => close
close + changes => prompt
close + no changes => close


The close button will be removed in the near future, but the functionality and behaviour remain as on a desktop you will always have the ""X"" button by which you can close a form. The inclusion of a separate close button was really to provide a bigger target...

Edit

Just for good measure, here is Joel's view on disabling/hiding menu items (which is ""DON'T"") http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/07/01.html

I have come to the conclusion that it applies to buttons as well.

In response to JohnGB's comment

The back button in a browser never submits a form, it always has the implicit meaning of a cancel. Any app, whether on a desktop, in a browser or on a mobile, that supports ""back"" navigation should really stick to that unwritten standard. And it doesn't even matter whether you follow an explicit save or an auto-save paradigm. It just means that using an explicit save paradigm you will have to provide a ""save"" button and in an auto-save paradigm ""back"" is just that ""back"".

$(""#multiselect_container"").append('&lt;img id=""loader"" src=""/loader.gif"" /&gt;');


Above 2 functions inside the $(""#list"").click() block are being skipped for some reason in IE, not FF, Chrome

$(""#list"").click(function() 
{           
    var selection = $(this).val();

    $(""#multiselect"").hide();
    $(""#multiselect_container"").append('&lt;img id=""loader"" src=""/loader.gif"" /&gt;');

    $.ajax(
    {
        url: 'include/ajax.php?id='+selection,
        async: false,
        dataType: 'json',
        success: function (json) 
        {       
            $(""#loader"").remove();
            $(""#multiselect"").show();

            //parse json
        } 
    });//json
});


What's going on:

There is a button #list and a container #multiselect_container which holds #multiselect which is a select box of it's container's size.

When #list is clicked, the select box is hidden and the container beneath it is shown, with a loading bar.

When the ajax call is finished the loading bar is removed and the select box is shown again.

In Firefox this works perfectly fine. In IE it does not.

Things that I have tried:


$('#list').ajaxComplete(function() {}); in the success section
Sleeping the php file for 3 seconds. Same results, except with a delay.
Removing the ajax block, those 2 calls are made properly.
caching is not the issue, ajax calls are being made

",lewicki,https://stackoverflow.com/users/255543,"You should change async: false to async: true. With async: false it would be normal behaviour for the display to not be updated until after the ajax call has completed. So that change might be enough to fix it. Otherwise read on...

I've had a similar problem with IE before, where it just didn't want to update the display to show a ""loading"" type message while doing Ajax - even though the Ajax is asynchronous. It's not that the functions themselves are skipped, just that the display doesn't get updated until after the Ajax complete callback had executed too - and since the complete processing removes the ""loading"" message it's as if it never existed from the user's point of view. As with your code, my project worked fine in Firefox. It was a while ago, but if I remember rightly I got it to work in IE by introducing a short timeout on the Ajax call, something like this:

$(""#list"").click(function() 
{           
    var selection = $(this).val();

    $(""#multiselect"").hide();
    $(""#multiselect_container"").append('&lt;img id=""loader"" src=""/loader.gif"" /&gt;');

    setTimeout(function() {
       $.ajax(
       {
           url: 'include/ajax.php?id='+selection,
           async: true,  // changed from false
           dataType: 'json',
           success: function (json) 
           {       
               $(""#loader"").remove();
               $(""#multiselect"").show();

               //parse json
           } 
       });//json
    }, 5);

Make a new service say MyUserService that will implement org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetailsService and has annotation @Service. UserDetailsService only has one method loadUserByUserName. Implementation of this method will be in MyUserService. It will look like this.

@Service
public class MyUserService implements UserDetailsService {

@Override
public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String arg0)
        throws UsernameNotFoundException {

    MyUser user=new MyUser();
    /*get details of user and authorities from database whose username is   
            arg0 and place them in user instance */
    return user;
}

}

MyUser is also a new class that implements org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails and all its methods are implemented inside MyUser class. It will look like this.

public class MyUser implements UserDetails {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
/*All the variables their getter setters that you wish to store in session. And    
   implementation of all the methods of UserDetails go here.*/

 }

Define a bean like this
&lt;bean id=""customUserDetailsService"" class=""org.aurora.timeexpense.service.MyUserService""/&gt;


Where org.aurora.timeexpense.service.MyUserService is the path of my defined service that implements UserDetailsService.

4.And Spring Security Configuration will go like this

       &lt;authentication-provider user-service-ref=""customUserDetailsService""&gt;

I don't know what is causing this noise, but I think that it could be any of this things:


pedal
crank arm/pedal connection
crankset


I think the material of all these things is alluminium.

I don't feel anything (like a bad shifted chain) when I hear the noise.

It happens when there is movement and when there is NO movement (I use the brake, so the bike doesn'e move, stand using all weight on right pedal, and it makes the noise)

The pedals could be in any position, It is not in a particular position. Just pressing the right pedal.

Has someone else has this ""problem""? Any ideas of where this comes from?

Update:
Yesterday I took out the chain and stood on the right pedal, and made the noise. Then is not the chain, nor the transmission system.

I put oil in the pedal axis, but had no luck. Also tried to loose the pedal, but the juncture point is too tight, and I couldn't.

Today I will try to use oil in the bottom bracket.

9636,Throwing a ball upwards in an accelerating train,"If I throw a ball upwards to a certain height in an accelerating train, will it end up in my hand? At the moment I release the ball, it will have a velocity equal to that of the train at that instant. But because the train is accelerating, the train will have a greater velocity and thus the ball will travel lesser distance and should fall behind me. Is my reasoning correct?
",user34304,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/34304,"User Sahil Chadha has already answered the question, but here's the math and a pretty picture for anyone who is unconvinced that you're right.

Since the train is accelerating, from the perspective of an observer on the train, the ball will experience a (fictitious) force in the direction opposite the train's travel having magnitude $ma$ where $m$ is the mass of the ball and $a$ is the magnitude of the acceleration of the train.  If we call the direction of travel the positive $x$-direction, and if we call the ""up"" direction the positive $y$-direction, then the equations of motion in the $x$- and $y$-directions will therefore be as follows:
\begin{align}
  \ddot x &amp;= -a \\ 
  \ddot y &amp;= -g.
\end{align}
The general solution is
\begin{align}
  x(t) &amp;= x_0 + v_{x,0} t - \frac{1}{2}a t^2 \\
  y(t) &amp;= y_0 + v_{y,0} t - \frac{1}{2}g t^2
\end{align}
Now, let's say that the origin of our coordinate system lies at the point from which the ball is thrown so that $x_0 = y_0 = 0$ and that the ball is thrown up at time $t=0$ with velocity $v_{y,0} = v$ and $v_{x,0} = 0$ in the positive $y$-direction, then the solutions becomes
\begin{align}
  x(t) &amp;= -\frac{1}{2}a t^2\\
  y(t) &amp;= vt - \frac{1}{2} gt^2
\end{align}
So what does this trajectory look like?  By solving the first equation for $t$, and plugging this back into the equation for $y$, we obtain the following expression for the $y$ coordinate of the particle as a function of its $x$ coordinate along the trajectory:
\begin{align}
  y(x) = v\sqrt{-\frac{2x}{a}} +\frac{g}{a} x
\end{align}
Here's a Mathematica plot of what this trajectory looks like for $v = 1.0\,\mathrm m/\mathrm s$ and the list $a = 9.8,5.0,2.5,1,0.1\,\mathrm m/\mathrm s^2$ of values for the train's acceleration



From the point of view of someone on the train, the ball flies backward in a sort of deformed parabola, but the smaller the acceleration is, the more it simply looks as it would if you were to throw a ball vertically in an un-accelerated train.

It needs a base resistor for the BJT or use a logic-level MOSFET. R1 could be something like 10K and the base resistor 20K or so. The p-channel MOSFET should be logic level for your conditions. You can find dual p/n channel units in an SO8 that can handle some amperes. 

The problem with switching the ground connection (low side switch) is that there are two power supplies on the chip and the inputs will end up biased at some voltage above ground, which may draw unnecessary current and/or be bad for your micro. 

You still have to bring the outputs of your micro low or you will drive unnecessary current into the L298 inputs.

Or is there something else I need to be doing? 

All my designs are always vectors within Photoshop, so text/shapes/designs done with the pen tool - I just need to know that they'll still be a vector for people who don't have Photoshop and can't open it in there to resize it.
",Willow,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/3494,"To a degree.....

With the exception of Live Type, Photoshop creates vector containers with raster fills. What this means is the edges of shape layers will remain crisp and clear when resized because the shape/vector layer edge is saved as a vector and it is recalculated when resized.

However, what is inside the shape layer is not vector. For example, if you create a shape/vector layer and then apply a pattern overlay, an inner glow, and a drop shadow, all those layer styles are not vector and will not scale infinitely. Layer styles are always raster and are bound by raster limitations.

Live type is vector and will remain vector and scalable when used in a Photoshop file and saved as an EPS. However, at times live type can be converted to outlines in eps files to maintain appearance. When converted to outlines, the type loses it's hinting properties and although it is vector, it may not look ideal at smaller sizes. Type is generally not a problem for anything above 12-14 points though.

As DA01 pointed out, eps is merely a file wrapper. Simply saving as an eps does not mean something is vector. EPS can contain 100% raster content or 100% vector content or a mix of the two. When using Photoshop, you always get a mix of the two if you have type and/or shape/vector layers. It is not possible to create a true vector file with any version Photoshop regardless of what you do.

  “A variable so related to another that for each value assumed by one there is a value determined for the other.” (thefreedictionary.com)


I can’t find any possible way how to start with this words. I’d like to say what I don’t know at least, but only to fail to do so. I hope to be got the right parse and its meaning.
",Listenever,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/504,"First of all, note that, like most dictionary definitions, this is not a complete sentence. To make it a complete sentence, we can read it as ""[A function is] a variable so related..."".

Second, note that the noun ""variable"" is implied in the prepositional phrase beginning with to, and in a few other places thereafter:

A variable so related to another [variable]...

Third, I think you may be getting tripped up by the adverb so, which is used in a nonintuitive way in this definition. It is used here in the sense of ""in such a way"" or ""in the manner indicated"":

A variable [that is] related to another [in such a way] that for each value assumed by one there is a value determined for the other.

This is roughly the same sense in which you use the word yourself: ""...only to fail to do so."" 

The reason it's confusing here is that although the word ""related"" is being used here as a verb in the past tense, ""related"" can be used as an adjective as well. And when we see the construction ""[noun] ([verb]) so [adjective],"" the word so is usually used in a different sense--that of an intensifier indicating a greatness of degree:

...a man so old his hair was as white as snow.

Knowing all this, we can rewrite the definition in a way that may be clearer to you:

[A function is] a variable [that is] related to another [variable] [in such a way] that for each value assumed by one [variable] there is a value determined for the other [variable].

1485,"Good travel games for two players, especially for playing on trains?","I would be interested to hear if anyone had recommendations for 2-player games that are particularly suitable for playing while travelling on trains.  (I ask this as someone who mostly enjoys games like Carcassonne, Power Grid, Agricola, Pandemic, etc. around the table at home.)  To be specific, the things that I think are important properties for these games are:


Needing minimal table space.  Most trains have a small table you could use, but not much more.
Being quiet to play, so that other passengers won't be disturbed.  For example, I imagine that games that involve repeatedly rolling dice wouldn't be appreciated.
Packing down small, so that they don't take up much luggage space.
Not requiring batteries or a power socket.  (I appreciate that an iPhone or a Nintendo DS for each player might be a good solution more generally, but it's not what I'm after in this case.)
Not being so delicate to arrange that motion from the train will unduly disrupt the play.


I think it would be best to recommend one game (or class of games) per answer, if that's appropriate, and explain why you think it's particularly suitable.  (Incidentally, I've read the guidance on good questions about game recommendations and hope this question meets the criteria.)

Update: Thanks for so many excellent suggestions - we certainly won't be short of games for our next long train journey :)

Read full guide here for more detailed explanations about the marked colors and places.

For average skill games with low warding and no counterwards,you should focus mainly on red dots especially 2 hills near the runes with the priority of upper one in early game and lower one later when killing roshan becomes more likely.


Having at least one ward near the rune will eliminate the chance of
going the wrong side when timing runes
the hills will give you more vision than placing wards on the ground
easily prevent ganks since the river is most common way for ganking
seeing enemy team attacking roshan is huge advantage
also it reveals path near secret shop and neutral camp 




Wards should be placed as early as it gets and replaced just a bit before they expire(you can see the timer),it is the best if you can go grab a rune and place new ward at the same time so you don't lose much ""lane time"",if it is on opposite lane you could port there and combine it with a gank or push attempt.

",Eric,https://superuser.com/users/15673,"When you say you can't compact the file, what are you actually doing?  By this, I mean that ""compacting"" in Thunderbird is not like running your inbox through a compression algorithm like you would to create a .zip file.

The ""compact"" option in Thunderbird is there because deleting a message does not remove the message from your disk, it is just hidden - therefore, you use ""compact"" to remove these ""deleted"" messages from the data file.

You will need to clean out your mailbox by saving and deleting messages that are no longer needed and then running the ""compact"" option.

Depending on the policies of the journal to which you submit the article, you may need to disclose the prior submission, and explain why you withdrew the publication from consideration.

Unfortunately, there's little you can do to stop the publishers of the first journal from doing something unsavory with your article. You will need to exercise vigilance in monitoring the work in this area to ensure that the paper isn't mishandled or worse. Be sure to maintain records of all of the correspondence you have had with the journal—and make sure of all it is documentable—phone calls won't suffice here.

However, if all the journal has is a PDF of your original article, it makes it a lot harder to do anything with it: it is tedious work to convert it into the template that most publishers use without significant effort.

Here's what I'd like to do:  See a simple graph that shows how much of my money went to Savings each month.

The closest I've found is the ""Net Worth"" chart, where the amount it goes up (or down) is the amount I've saved (or overspent).  I'd like one that shows (Total Income - Total Expenses) over time.  I've also tried the ""Income/Expense"" Graph, but that shows separate bars for income and expense, and I want to show a single bar (or a line graph would be nice too).
",Tim,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/10199,"I found a way to do this, but it's slightly backwards.

Quicken does not allow you to make a graph of just your income, probably because that would be a fairly boring graph for most people.  But it does allow you to do a graph of your expenses.  Doing so, while including income categories, will produce the graph I want, but with negative numbers (savings is negative spending).


Go to Reports -> Reports and Graph Center in the main menu.
In the Quicken Standard Reports section, go to Spending by Category
Click the Customize button.
On the Customize Spending by Category window, on the Categories tab, add all Income and Expense categories (but no Bank categories).
Click Show Graph.
Set the Column to Month.  This will switch it from a pie chart to a bar graph


This will show a bar graph of overall spending, counting income as Negative Spending.  So, having negative bars is good in this case.

Tied into that question, it seems possible that a wizard can kill someone and not create a horcrux (Peter Pettigrew killed Cedric Digory but no one seemed concerned that Peter made a horcrux), so how/why did Harry Potter wind up with a sliver of Voldemort's soul when it seems inconceivable that Voldemort's intention was to put one there?
",Xantec,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/1234,"Yes, a witch or wizard creating a Horcrux can choose the object into which the Horcrux is concealed. Speaking specifically of Voldemort's Horcruxes, Harry and Dumbledore discuss vessels for Horcruxes:


  ""And they could be anything?"" said Harry. ""They could be old tin cans or, I dunno, empty potions bottles . . . .""
  
  ""You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potions bottles to guard his own precious soul?""
  
  Half-Blood Prince - Page 504 - US Hardcover


What is a little murky is whether or not an ordinary object can be used to create a Horcrux, or if an item of significance (Slytherin's locket; Ravenclaw's diadem; Gryffindor's sword; Hufflepuff's cup; etc) is required. The above passage is referring specifically to Voldemort. 

Simply committing a murder does not create a Horcrux. It is one step required. Reference Tom Riddle's conversation with Horace Slughorn while Riddle was still a student at Hogwarts: 


  ""But how do you do it?""
  
  ""By an act of evil -- the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion--""
  
  ""Encase? But how--?""
  
  ""There is a spell, do not ask me, I don't know!"" said Slughorn . . .
  
  Half-Blood Prince - Page 498 - US Hardcover


J.K. Rowling has not revealed the exact steps necessary in making a Horcrux; according to the HP Wiki, J.K. Rowling plans on releasing the exact spell and process in her Harry Potter Encyclopedia; the process is apparently very gruesome. 

An accidental Horcrux can be created, such as in the case of Harry.


  ""[...]on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort's soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry[...]""
  
  Deathly Hallows - Page 686 - US Hardcover
  
  ""You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived.""
  
  Albus Dumbledore - Deathly Hallows - Page 709 - US Hardcover


So, technically, when Voldemort cast the Killing Curse, it rebounded against him, severing yet another part of his soul. That part of Voldemort's soul sought out a living host, the only available vessel being Harry; it attached itself to Harry. How Voldemort managed to create this Horcrux without the apparently necessary accompanying spell being incanted, I am unsure.

6642,How can natural selection occur at species level whilst not occuring at the individual level?,"The chapter by Douglas Futuyma in 'Evolution' (Losos et al 2013, Princeton) states that natural selection can occur at the species level. Futuyma states that if natural selection occurs at the species level it does not occur at the individual level: 


  Neither gene selection nor species selection has molded the advantageous characteristics of individual organisms; rather, they have affected properties at the gene level or at the species level. 


But how does natural selection occuring at the species level not affect individuals? Surely any selective advantage of a particular species must occur among particular individuals of that species. For example, if Species A is selected because it is browner than Species B, this will be because individuals of Species A are browner than individuals of Species B. 
",luciano,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1216,"I think you have misunderstood the passage. Here is a larger section (found at google books):


  Natural selection can also occur at the level of species, for certain characteristics enhance the rate of origin of new species or diminish the likelihood of species extinction. For instance, the number of species in lineages of herbivorous insects has generally increased faster than in closely related lineages that have other feeding habits. Neither gene selection nor species selection has molded the advantageous characteristics of individual organisms; rather, they have affected properties at the gene level or at the species level. But individual selection, selection among individual organisms within populations, is at the center of evolutionary theory. It is at this level that selection explains most of the adaptive features of organisms.


Going through this part-by-part; the first two sentences state that lineage/species selection can occur, in the sense that species traits can enhance the speciation rate of a lineage or decrease their risk of extinction, relative to other lineages (e.g. in herbivorous insects). 

He is then saying that the traits that are the target of this selection are not traits of individuals but traits/properties of the species/lineage. 

An example might help to explain the point. For instance, it has been argued that pelagic larvae in sessile ocean species will lead to higher dispersal rates, which means that species can colonize new environments, and this can lead to speciation through adaptive radiation (Jablonski &amp; Hunt, 2006). A larger range will also correspond to lower extinction rates (everything else equal). The trait might also be fixed within a lineage (so there is no variance at the individual level within-species), and if so, this lineage as a whole could have higher speciation rates and lower extinction rates compared to a sister lineage that lacks pelagic larvae. 

The individuals within species will naturally have the underlying traits (pelagic larvae), but the traits that are selected at the lineage level (extinction risk &amp; speciation rate) are not properties of individuals but are traits of the lineage/species. 

He then ends by continuing with ""normal"" individual selection, and states that processes at this level is responsible for most adaptive features of organisms. It should also be noted that lineage selection is still considered controversial, and it has been shown that it is inherently much weaker than selection at the individual level. Personally, I think there are some very good examples of how species/lineage selection can function, but to what extent it is an important process for species and organisms is an open empirical question. If you are interested to look further, Jablonski (2008) and Okasha (2007) are two good starting points.

4500,"Is encrypting a single 128 bit block with AES ECB ""safe""","I want to encrypt a small piece of data that is less that 16 bytes in size (think SSN), and I'll be using a 256bit encryption key.  The typical suggestion is to never use ECB, but if there is just a single block being encrypted, is it a concern?

The reason I want to use ECB is because I want the encrypted value of the block to be consistent between encryptions for other reasons (so I can check if a value already exists by just comparing the uniqueness of the cipherText).

Updated: Also note that these encrypted values will be stored in a set, so there will not be data leakage by having multiple encrypted values of the same plainText available.
",edhill,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/6569,"16 bytes is 128 bits, which matches the block size of AES-256, but not ""256 bit block"" in the (original) title. Hence the question is ambiguous: was it meant 16, or 32 bytes?

For 16 bytes: ECB reduces to single-block encryption, and yes ECB is safe, for a definition of safe that let one test identity of plaintexts by testing identity of the ciphertexts.

For 32 bytes (e.g. a US SSN encoded in UTF16 or perhaps ASN.1 or XML): no, ECB is unsafe. This extend to any standard block cipher mode of operation modified by fixing IV. Problem is, plaintexts that match in the first block, but not the second, will match in the first block of the ciphertext, but not the second, which leaks information (e.g. in the US SSN format, it allows to cluster plaintexts by identical area number if the block frontier happens to be on the right of that). You need a 256-bit block cipher, such as Rijndael (a superset of AES) instantiated with 256-bit block. There are ways to construct a 256-bit block cipher from AES-256, but I know none with both a sound security argument and either a short statement, or performance close to Rijndael.

Note: Public key encryption can not be used in the context where ""encrypted value of the block (is) to be consistent between encryptions"" and the plaintext is low-entropy (enumerable, or guessable). Here, there are few enough SSNs that they can all be enciphered by anyone (knowing the public key), and compared with the ciphertext, leaking the plaintext.

Update: it is now clear that the question is about 16 bytes. I wonder if some day, UTFx with x>8 will catch in the US.

7449,"Control Fields vs Heap ""Mock"" Fields for Branching Trigger Behavior","I've seen solutions that talk about adding control fields to allow for clever trigger branching in problems like this. I know that works, but it annoys me (feels architecturally wrong) to create such fields if it can be avoided. I've also seen solutions that have to do with using static variables for a similar purpose, but I have found occasions where one global flag is not good enough because I need the flag per record. I've tried both out and I think I want something in the middle. Something like this:

global without sharing class HeapControl {
    private static Map&lt;Id, Set&lt;String&gt;&gt; recordTags = new Map&lt;Id, Set&lt;String&gt;&gt;();
    public static void AddRecordTag(Id rowId, String tag) {

            Set&lt;String&gt; tagsForThisRow = recordTags.get(rowId);
            if (!tagsForThisRow.contains(tag)) {
                tagsForThisRow.add(tag);
            }
        } else {
            recordTags.put(rowId, new Set&lt;String&gt; { tag });
        }
    }

        if (recordTags.containsKey(rowId)) {
            Set&lt;String&gt; tagsForThisRow = recordTags.get(rowId);
            if (tagsForThisRow.contains(tag)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    @IsTest 
    public static void HeapDemo() {
        Account a = new Account(Name = 'Testing');
        insert a;
        HeapControl.AddRecordTag(a.Id, 'Control-Field-Name-1');
        a.Name = 'Testing2';
        update a;
        // A trigger that fired on Account Update could check the HeapControl for the record like this
        system.assert(HeapControl.IsRecordTagged(a.Id, 'Control-Field-Name-1'));
    }
}


I'd like a pro-con analysis of using real control fields vs mock control fields on the heap (doesn't have to be my code, anything along the lines of static Map&lt;Id, ...&gt;, if you know of a field-tested version of this code please share). 

In my not-yet-field-tested opinion, the control field concept evolved out of a workflow world, but once you decide to drop down to triggers the heap will serve you better--at least you don't have to create control fields for every little trigger branch.

I apologize this isn't standard Q&amp;A format--but this issue has been burning in my mind for months now and I think there are a lot of Salesforce developers (writing business process triggers in particular) that wrestle with this regularly. Thanks in advance for sharing your wisdom and experience!
",twamley,https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/773,"At the outset, the way I look at it, the first line of the question is a bit of an apples with oranges comparison, i.e. use of Control Fields in a Workflow - Trigger distributed situation Vs in a Trigger only scenario.

Analysing this problem in parts may help answer each of the two facets, one at a time.

One - the interplay of Workflows and Triggers to implement Business Logic. It is up for debate how logic should be distributed, if not all of it can be accomplished in a trigger. Should workflows be used to implement as much is feasible, and only the absolute can't do's must live in a trigger. In my opinion yes, unless the resulting complexity is insanely great. Using declarative features provisioned by the platform allows for taking advantage of any of the forthcoming features of the platform, for eg. cross object workflows precluded the needs for at least some of those early-days cross object triggers.

If you need to straddle logic across workflows and triggers, the 'heap' is the database, and control fields end up becoming the 'static' heap variables.

This is the only situation in which, in my opinion, control fields may be advocated.

The other facet is the use cases for use of control fields - If the resulting complexity of a distributed operation is too great, or if all of it can only be implemented in a trigger, than static 'heap' variables make the most sense, I can't see the needs for any entity specific control variables, although there may be a limited case for User level control fields, particularly in cases, where doing so may prove more efficient to streamline data integration / migration processes.

Immediate Implications

Just talking a little bit about your other question that led to this thread, you are looking at the use of Control Field to distribute logic between a trigger and a workflow vs customising the input using Visualforce, so you can clearly demarcate the source of the change.

Going down a VisualForce route (which I have done for cases like OpportunityContactRoles, where triggers / workflows are not possible) means investing in a test class besides the cost of maintainability and the danger of subverting any new features that become available in out of the box page layouts, eg. inline editing that came to PageLayouts, and it was some time, before that became available in Visualforce. Declarative should always be the preferable approach, unless there are really strong motivations for going custom, as more often than not, it ends up being more expensive in the long run (the cost of maintainability, test classes and deployment inclusive)

A Cohen may not come in contact with a corpse, nor be under the same roof as a corpse, nor come within 4 Amot (~2 meters) of a grave. If he does, he has transgressed, and needs to repent, but no other practical consequences.
Nidah - menstruation, as you already mentioned. Nowadays, after menstruation a wife may not have relations (or any other physical contact) with her husband until after she has counted 7 clean days and gone to a Mikvah.

You were not allowed into the Temple unless you were Tahor.
You could not touch Terumah and Challah (the tithing and piece of dough given to a Cohen) unless you were Tahor. Otherwise they became impure and had to be burned. Nowadays we burn them, as we are all considered impure.
You had to keep away from people and items which were Tahor in order not to make them impure.

$R_n(\omega)=1\ \Longleftrightarrow\ $the $n^{th}$ binary digit of $\omega$ is 1 (i.e. $x_n=1$)   $(II)$.  

Some prefer this as the definition of the Rademacher functions.
I would like to know why these two definitions are equivalent, that is why the equivalences $(I)$ and $(II)$ hold. Intuitively I understand it, but I can't seem to write it down as a rigorous mathematical proof.  

Thanks in advance!  

EDIT:
I corrected the $\Delta_{k,n}$ sets. As it was, it wasn't a proper partition of $(0,1)$ (some elements were not included - the right endpoints of the $\Delta_{k,n}$'s).
",Nick Papadopoulos,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/50118,"The fact that $R_n(\omega)=1$ means that $\omega$ belongs to $\Delta_{k,n}$ for some odd integer $k$. That is, $k\leqslant2^n\omega\lt k+1$ and $k=2\ell+\color{red}{1}$ for some integer $\ell$. Hence $2^n\omega=2\ell+\color{red}{1}+s$ with $0\leqslant s\lt 1$. Since $0\leqslant k\lt2^n$, $0\leqslant\ell\lt2^{n-1}$ and $\ell$ is a binary integer $\ell=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-2}\ell_i2^i$ with $\ell_i=0$ or $\ell_i=1$. Thus,
$$
\omega=\frac2{2^n}\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-2}\ell_i2^i+\frac{\color{red}{1}}{2^n}+\frac{s}{2^n}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}\frac{\ell_{n-i-1}}{2^i}+\frac{\color{red}{1}}{2^n}+\frac{s}{2^n}.
$$
This is the binary expansion of $\omega$, up to and including its $n$th bit, and this $n$th bit is $\color{red}{1}$.

To solve the case $R_n(\omega)=-1$, rewrite the whole paragraph replacing each $\color{red}{1}$ by $\color{blue}{0}$.

240,PhD dissertation different from master thesis; What might I be able to do about methodology?,"I understand that it's possible, thankfully, to have your dissertation in a different topic from your master's thesis, but I seem to have a problem (see below). Do you know any other problems might I run into?

Background on me:

I am finishing up my master's in mathematical finance and now plan to pursue a PhD with my dissertation being in stochastic analysis/calculus, a branch of mathematics used in finance and physics.

My background on stochastic analysis:

I have had 3 classes related to stochastic analysis and 2 classes applying the concepts.

My thesis, being on the P-side of mathematical finance, has extremely little relevance to stochastic analysis, which is more used in the Q-side of mathematical finance.

The ONLY time stochastic analysis ever came up was encountering something in a paper that gives probabilities in the Q-side, and I thought of using a theorem to convert them to the P-side but later found out the paper was unnecessary or inapplicable (I forgot; I think I figured out another solution).

One problem I seem to have:

Some PhD applications seem to require a PhD proposal including a hypothesis, literature review and methodology.

I am not quite sure how mathematical research is conducted. Most of my research has been mainly in finance and statistics. What might I be able to do about this?

I am considering taking a second master's if needed but hopefully it need not come to that.
",Jack Bauer,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/22511,"If you are accepted into a PhD program, you should consider your dissertation topic to be independent of, and separate from your masters thesis topic. A PhD dissertation is fundamentally different from a Masters thesis.  A PhD dissertation is expected to make a new contribution to research (however small), whereas a Masters thesis is a summary and application of existing research.  PhD dissertations are a deeper dive into a topic or research questions, and an attempt to shed new light on the topic or questions.

You may have a Masters thesis that leads naturally into a deeper investigation as a PhD dissertation.  Or not. You should focus your attention on the topics and questions that motivate your interest in a PhD.  What are the core, unanswered questions?  Which of these questions can you, with your skills and interests, address with some chance of success?  

Leave behind the details of your Masters thesis.  Focus on what you have learned in the process, and what new skills or capabilities you have.  Now, with these insights, you should engage with surveys of research in your field -- those describing the unsolved problems or most critical questions.

template &lt;typename T&gt;
void memTest()
{
    T * pLast = new T();

So I ran this with char, int, ci. Most allocations were a fixed length from the last, sometimes there were odd jumps from one available block to another.

sizeof(char) : 1
Average Jump: 64 bytes

sizeof(int): 4
Average Jump: 16

sizeof(ci): 8 (int has to be placed on a 4 byte align)
Average Jump: 9

Can anyone explain why the allocator is fragmenting memory like this? Also why is the jump for char so much larger then ints and a structure that contains both an int and char.  
",Jason T.,https://stackoverflow.com/users/244941,"There are two issues:


most allocators store some additional data prior to the start of the block (typically block size and a couple of pointers)
there are usually alignment requirements, e.g. Linux typically allocates to at least an 8 byte boundary, OS X allocates to at least a 16 byte boundary


So you'll nearly always get some kind of gap between successive allocations.

Of course you should never rely on any specific behaviour for something like this, where the implementation is free to do as it pleases.

9646,When should a supervisor be a co-author?,"What are people's views on this?  To be specific: suppose a PhD student has produced a piece of original mathematical research. Suppose that student's supervisor suggested the problem, and gave a few helpful comments, but otherwise did not contribute to the work.  Should that supervisor still be named as a co-author, or would an acknowledgment suffice?

I am interested in two aspects of this. Firstly the moral/etiquette aspect: do you consider it bad form for a student not to name their supervisor?  Or does it depend on that supervisor's input?  And secondly, the practical, career-advancing aspect: which is better, for a student to have a well-known name on his or her paper (and hence more chance of it being noticed/published), or to have a sole-authored piece of work under their belt to hopefully increase their chances of being offered a good post-doc position?

[To clarify: original question asked by MrB ]
",MrB,https://mathoverflow.net/users/2189,"As a non-mathematician, I am somewhat mystified by the prevailing norms of the mathematics community as I understand them from this thread. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like: 


Supervisors make important intellectual contributions to the thesis work of their students. 
Typically, the name of the supervisor does not appear on the work. 


For example, the most upvoted comment at the moment says ""as a rule the supervisor should not be a co-author in the main paper taken from a student's thesis, even if he has contributed substantially to it."" (emphasis is mine) Other comments echo the sentiment. 

This seems problematic, both morally and practically. In other scientific communities, the author list is supposed to reflect the people who contributed intellectually to the paper. Manipulating it is an ethical offense. For example, the practices described in this thread appear to violate IEEE policies on authorship which state (Section 8.2.1)


  Authorship and co-authorship should be
  based on a substantial  intellectual
  contribution ... the
  list of authors on an article serves
  multiple purposes; it  indicates who
  is responsible for the work and to
  whom questions  regarding the work
  should be addressed.


Finally, I would just like to add that as a student, I would feel horrible submitting a paper authored only by me if the paper was based in large part on the insights of someone else.

Can you explain me difference in this 3 example?

",Yaro,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/59850,"
Example 1 does not properly show any voltage source as Vref - it can come from ADVREF or VDD_MAIN
Example 2 has a potential divider (R307 and R306) forming a voltage that is buffered by the OP-AMP. This uses a voltage reference chip (a 4.096 shunt regulator) across the potential divider to keep things fairly stable if the power rail (VCC_P5V0) moves around.
Example 3 uses a 3V reference (or 3.3V aka VCC33) directly connectable to the VREF pin.


Example 1 should be ignored and you should concentrate on 2 and 3.

Example 3 is the most stable when linked to the voltage reference. Example 2 will be less stable because it uses a potential divider and an op-amp and these add errors to the voltage produced from the reference.


  In ex.3, if I apply a 3.3v to LM4040 with a 2.2k Resistor, I'll still
  have 3.0v?


This is because it is a shunt regulator i.e. it works like a zener diode (read the device data sheet)

  John lives in London and Mary lives in London.


A subject including a joint and cannot be expanded in this way. So,


  John and Mary are a happy couple

  John is a happy couple and Mary is a happy couple.


Often, however, there is no way to reliably interpret if the and is a distributive coordinator or a joint coordinator. For example:


  John made cheese and cucumber sandwiches.


Did all the sandwiches consist of both cheese and cucumber (joint coordination) or did he make cheese sandwiches and also make cucumber sandwiches (distributive coordination)?

But the SerialPort class of .NET set them to:

I suppose that I have two questions:


What do these bytes mean?
How can I tell SerialPort to use a specific set of special characters?


The latter is all I really care about, but I suspect the former is going to be useful to know.



Update: The following doesn't work:

byte[] specialchars = {

    0x00,
    0x11,

BRK — don't know
EVT — set to 0x1a, you cannot change it in .NET

XOFF — set to 0x13, you cannot change it in .NET, and it doesn't even usually make sesn

4314,Can you make a hash out of a stream cipher?,"A comment on another question made me wonder about something:


  Assume you're on a rather constrained platform &mdash; say, a low-end embedded device &mdash; with no built-in crypto capabilities, but you do have access to a simple stream cipher; say, RC4 or one of the eSTREAM ciphers.  What other crypto primitives can you build out of that stream cipher?  In particular, are there any practical ways to build a cryptographic hash function and/or a MAC out of just a stream cipher?


We already have questions about turning a hash into a stream cipher and about turning a stream cipher into a block cipher, but this particular transformation doesn't seem to have been covered yet.

Obviously, if the platform constraints permit it, one could ignore the stream cipher and just implement a standard hash function from the ground up.  What I'm wondering is whether having the stream cipher available might let one do better than that in terms of code size, memory usage and/or speed.

While a construction that treats the stream cipher as a black box would be nice, schemes that only use parts of the stream cipher (like RC4-Hash, which, alas, has practical collision attacks) would be interesting too, at least if they're simple enough.
",Ilmari Karonen,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/598,"This is a really bad idea. Most stream ciphers, certainly RC4 and anything in a Counter Mode construction are ultimately a PRNG XORed onto the plaintext. This is fine for encryption -- the information theory is pretty easy to understand -- but is no basis for a hash function.

The goals of a hash function and a cipher are different. As it turns out, you can make a block cipher into a hash function, but even then not any block cipher makes for a good hash function.

Think of it this way -- a cipher is like a game of cards. It relies upon the fact that you can't see what's in your opponent's hand, and what makes it hard or intractable is the uncertainty. But a hash function is like a game of chess. Everyone knows everything, and the goal of the hash function is to make it so complex that you can't go backwards and that there's no easy way to predict forwards.

Take a look at the pic and see from left are two USB 3.0 external drives and the last is my internal sata C drive that is showing issues. SMART scan came back A-ok! Kind of clueless here.



Update Back with some better news, after uninstalling the drive in device manager, booting into safemode then out again, I got this and confirmed it through about 4 more of the tests:

Testing on another system now! Then RMA if need be.

As it stands now: Sometimes getting full speed, mostly getting capped 40MBps write :(

Could someone please take a look at the SMART data and tell me if anything looks off to you?


Well guys, I think I've finally figured it out. It seems to have been a temp issue. I took some action to reduce temps, and attached two big solid copper blocks with thermal paste to the label side of the hdd. Temps now are going from 50c-60c variably. I'm probably going to make use of my eSata port on this thing, and relocate the internal drive to an external enclosure and eventually put in an SSD in the near future. :) My guess was the drive was going into a low power mode to reduce temps. That's the only thing I can think of.
",DemonCamber,https://superuser.com/users/369153,"I've seen similar drive behavior caused by a misbehaving flash chip on the PCB.
It would show faster, almost normal write speed for a short while after boot (the system has been turned off for a few hours before that). Then only the write speed will start fluctuating and then go slow again. If this is the case here I would test on a different system to confirm the results and if there is no change - go for RMA.
However if it's performing as expected in safe mode for a long period of time, you should dig into Windows. It could be a driver, but it could also be a process. It could also be due to insufficient power, but that usually happens with external drives.

&lt;querystring&gt;

Then I use that variable in my sort:

&lt;xsl:sort data-type=""number"" order=""ascending"" select=""$sortby"" /&gt;

It's three times as large as my next-door neighbor, and four or five times the size of my neighbor's across the street. It's worse in the summer (I live in central TX), but I've had the air conditioner inspected, and while the house is right at the maximum capacity for our unit, the unit should still be able to take care of the load. That also doesn't explain why our winter bills are larger than the comparables.

What I would like to do is check the amount of current drawn by each running appliance and calculate where all my money is going. I just don't know how to go about doing this.
",moswald,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/168,"You could invest in a clamp on Ammeter like this



Then open up your electrical panel and measure the draw on each circuit, this will show you which circuits are drawing the most.

Also as Mike Powell pointed out, you could clamp on to the main lines and then turn off each breaker noting how much the value drops. (You will have to do this for each leg of the main). 

Once you know which circuits are drawing the most power, you can start eliminating devices on that circuit until you find the largest consumers. 

If you want you can figure out how much your devices cost to run like this.

 Watts = Amps * Volts
 Kilowatts = Watts/1000
 Kilowatt-hours = kilowatts * Hours used
 Cost = kilowatt-hours * cost per kilowatt-hour


Or

 Cost = (((Amps * Volts)/1000) * Hours Used) * Cost per Kilowatt


You could also do like I did and split an old extension cord (so you can clamp on to a single wire), then plug one end into the wall, and your device into the other end. Then you can measure the draw of just that device.

5433,Get latitude/longitude of friend's current_location using Graph FQL,"I'm trying to get the latitude/longitude of all of a user's friends using a single API call. I believe I need to write a multi-query FQL statement, but I can't get the syntax correct.

I believe the two queries need to be something like the following:

'""friends"":""SELECT uid,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""'

'""location"":""SELECT location FROM page WHERE id IN (SELECT current_location_id FROM #friends)""';


My problem is that somehow I need to get the ID of the current_location in the first query so that I can reference it in the second query, but I only know how to get an array that contains the id.

Thanks for any help!

Clarification:

I'm not trying to get check-ins of friends.  Instead I want to graph the ""current_location"" (i.e. where they live) of all of a user's friends on a Geo map.  I can get a user's ""current_location"" with the following FQL query:

""SELECT uid,sex,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""


This query returns the following array:

[current_location] =&gt; Array
            (
                [city] =&gt; New York
                [state] =&gt; New York
                [country] =&gt; United States
                [zip] =&gt; 
                [id] =&gt; 108424279189115
                [name] =&gt; New York, New York
            )


Which does not contain the longitude and latitude of the of the current_location (New York in the above example)

Therefore I now need to take the ID of the current_location (e.g. 108424279189115) and run a second FQL query such as:

""SELECT location,name FROM page WHERE page_id = 108424279189115)""


To get the latitude and longitude of the current_location.  Currently, I have a working code that runs the first FQL query, then extracts page_id in php, and then runs a second FQL query to get the current_location latitude/longitude.  However, for performance reasons I would like to run only one multi-query if this is possible.

})


will return two responses

one will be a list of friends UIDs, names and their current locations IDs

the other will be a list of unique location IDs with their name, description and geolocation info

EDIT: if you query for current_location using FQL, you'll get the full latlong in the first response and you don't even need the second one

Having made those disclaimers, it is my understanding that the producers or Vendors of a software program do not have any legal interest in any output file (in this case a mesh) that you produce with your software. Just as Micro$oft does not have any intellectual property rights in a novel you create with their word processing software, the purveyors of 3DS Mas probably do not have any intellectual property rights in your meshes. The only exception of which I am aware to this general principle is if the file format to which you are exporting is proprietary, in which case the file format might be copyright. But even then, while the file format might be subject to copyright, that copyright applies to the file format, not the file content.

If you must use NFS and don't have root access on the client, then my first thought is to find a userspace NFS client or NFS browser.  The only one I've found so far is JFtp, which is a Java GUI client.  However, if you're a programmer and so inclined, another option is to roll your own; there is a library called libnfs1 that you could build from.

I haven't tried either of them, but hopefully this is a start.  There may be more out there that I haven't noticed.  Finally, beware that the NFS server may require you to connect as root (from a privileged port), in which case you're out of luck.

400,Why does my switch need to be wired in this fashion?,"Today was my first foray into electronics since high school, in the form of some simple Raspberry Pi experiments. I managed to get a circuit working where a switch controlled an LED with a potentiometer to control the brightness of the LED.

However, I am confused by the wiring of the switch. Firstly, here's a photo of my amazing work:



NOTE: the black lead on the potentiometer is not connected to anything (hard to tell in the photo). Also, I realised afterwards that I could have just inserted the potentiometer into the breadboard rather than soldering wires to it. Noob mistake (one of many).

Here's an attempt at a schematic (also probably wrong because I don't know what I'm doing):







simulate this circuit &ndash; Schematic created using CircuitLab

As you can see, I used a PiFace, which comes with the four switches located at the left and towards the bottom of the photo. It is the wiring of this switch that befuddles me. Since each switch has two terminals, I was expecting one terminal to act as an input and the other as an output. That is, I just feed my circuit through those two terminals and job done. But that didn't work.

I managed to find this image online:



This is what prompted me to guess the configuration below, which works. However, I don't understand why it works. Nor do I understand why there are two terminals for each switch if only one seems to be used. I suspect the clue is embedded within the text in the above image:


  The four switches, numbered S1 to S4 are connected in parallel to the
  first four (0-3) inputs


However, I do not understand what this means. Perhaps a practical example of how I would use each terminal and an explanation of why the grounding is necessary would help my understanding.
",me--,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/35079,"For the grounding it's easy. Basically a switch can have not 2 but 3 state. Basically


High when pressed 
Undefined when unpressed and not grounded
Low when unpressed and ground








simulate this circuit &ndash; Schematic created using CircuitLab

Grounding it will allow you to make sure the output low, without that it's a short circuit. So basically you'll use a pull-up or pull-down resistor for that.

They are connected in parallel means they are not connected one after each other but side to side. Example







simulate this circuit

So from what I read in your question, the switch sound like a ""master switch"" who can act on both of the 3 other switch. If pressed, it's like all the switch are pressed. But hard to tell without precise schematics.

It would certainly be more than 99%. If, hypothetically, 0% of the sky would be dark, all objects would on average heat up to about 3,000 K (estimate for the average temperature of thermal radiation from stars, taking into account average redshifts according to the so-called cosmic time–redshift relation). Given that dwarf planet Eris reaches a surface temperature of 30 K, it must be that less than 1% of the lines of sight from Eris hit a star. 

This is of course a loose upper bound, as Eris is very close to the star called Sun. In other words, the temperature of 30 K is almost entirely due to the relatively large portion of the Eridian sky being covered by the sun. 

If you go to the Wikipedia page dedicated to Olbers' paradox, you can read similar reasoning leading to the conclusion:


  ""the sky is about fifty billion times darker than it would be if the
  universe were neither expanding nor too young to have reached

1162,"GIN/GiST Full Text searches through openlayers, geoserver and postgres","I have a a web app that automatically maps recent tweets and allows you to search for certain keywords. it uses Postgres for the database, geoserver as the server, and openlayers as the cartographic library. Right now tweet keywords are done using the ILIKE query.

This works pretty well if the keyword i'm looking for is a commonly used word, like 'love' , 'friend', 'OMG', etc. but less common words like ""geospatial"" need to search through a lot more data in order to find the last n instances of the word. This is dead slow.

To combat my slowness I'm building a GIN index on my tweet field in postgres. Two days later and i'm still waiting for the index to complete. Once it's built though, I'll try a few queries using SQL view parameters and hopefully this will dramatically speed things up.

Even if this approach works though, it's not going to be all that useful if the index takes so long to create -- the maintenance of it will not be able to keep up will the incoming flood of data. I think I will try out the GiST index next and see how long it takes as I understand it is much faster to this build index. 

Beyond this, what can I do next? Do options like Solr work with Geoserver?? Are there any common approaches to this type of problem and data size/rate?

According to this question, a feature is a collection of stories.  One of the answers suggest that a feature is actually an epic.  

So are features and epics considered the same thing, which is basically a collection of related user stories?

Our project manager insists that there's a hierarchical structure:

Epic -> Features -> User stories

... basically all user stories must fall within this structure.  Therefore all user stories must fall under an umbrella feature and all features must fall under an epic.

To me, that sounds awkward.  Can someone please clarify how user stories, features, and epics are related?  Or is there an article that clearly outlines the differences?

Epic is just a big Story (hierarchical)
Theme is just a group of Stories (pretty much like tag)


He actually avoids the term ""Feature"". I assume that it is mainly because it was a common term in the traditional waterfall world. Many Agile camp tends to use different terms to emphasize the differences.

",levesque,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/10,"External Tools



I find that a lot of the pain involved in creating LaTeX tables comes simply from laying them out- it's tough to make a table markup syntax that isn't tedious to type and modify.  Because of this, I use other programs to help me deal with some of the work involved in creating tables:


If my LaTeX editor has a table wizard, I use it to create the table.
If my data is in a spreadsheet, I use a plugin to export it to LaTeX.  For Excel, I use excel2latex and for OpenOffice I use calc2latex.
If my data is in R, I use the xtable package.


I find these tools take care of 80-95% of the work required to create a table- I then go through and refine some of the stylistic choices.  The only problem with this approach is that the tools aren't of much use if a table requires a substantial update or re-write or needs to be generated automatically from an arbitrary dataset.

LaTeX Packages



Personally, I use the Memoir class for the majority of my documents.  Memoir integrates the functionality of a ton of table packages such as booktabs and tabularx and integrates them in a sane way so your document doesn't end up with a list of \usepackage{}s that is a mile long.  See Chapter 11: Rows and Columns of the Memoir manual for a description of the support provided by the class for tabular material.

In addition to Memoir, I often augment it's capabilities with the following two packages:


The longtable package for laying out tables that flow across more than one page.  Longtable's handling of table headers and footers is extremely nice for putting things like ""Continued on the next page..."" exactly where they are supposed to be.
The siunitx package- this package is all about typesetting units and numbers.  The sinuitx package adds the S column descriptor which can be used to perform all kinds of advanced formatting for table columns that contain numbers such as:


Alignment of separators such as commas and decimal points.
Automatic rounding, truncation or conversion to scientific notation.

The length of the two songs can vary but the content of the two songs will remain the same.  

Currently I am using cross-correlation using FFT for finding the offset between them but it is not giving me correct results.  

For making the length of signals same I am zero padding the signal which is shorter in length. 

Can someone guide me what I am doing wrong in this problem ?

I really appreciate your responses.
Thanks

--

Thanks guys for replying.. 
I am doing in Python and using below algorithm for finding the offset:
1. Using librosa.load function to get the audio signals of both the songs.
2. Then I zero pad the shorter signal from last and make sure it is power of 2.
3. Find the FFT of the two signals using scipy library function of python.(spipy.fftpack.fft)
4. Once I get the fft , I take the cojugate of one of the signals.
5. Elementwise multiplication of the two fft signals
6. Doing ifft of the numpy array of the output signals after multiplication.
7. Finding the peak index of that array.

P.S. The song length can be around 5-6 mins so I am sampling at the rate of 44.1Khz . So you can expect very large sample space.
Also , the bitrate of the two songs can be different.(I am not sure that will effect it or not)

Any idea if I am doing wrong?

So as to preemptively answer the almost inevitable 'Why?', I will simply say that, as an orthodox Christian, my conscience doesn't allow me to play a game with such cards. I would prefer not to debate/explain this further, as I believe such a discussion is well beyond the scope of this site.

So you would have to spend quite a bit of your deck points on the doubled points from creatures not being a dark or fire type.

This may be doable, as you may be able to counter balance with some of the powerful Flame attack spells that can really do some damage, especially when combined with an equipment called Elemental Wand, to allow you to bind and recast the attack spells each turn.

3969,Continuous Dice rolls,"A dice is being rolled continuously. Suppose you roll a 3 ( or any number ). What is the probability that you will get the next ""3"" exactly after n rolls?  
",Chip,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/31661,"I will interpret ""after $n$ rolls"" as meaning that we want the probability that our next $n-1$ rolls do not yield a $3$, but the $n$-th roll does give a $3$..

The probability of a non-$3$ on any toss is $\frac{5}{6}$.  So the probability of $n-1$ consecutive non-$3$'s followed by a $3$ is
$$\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{n-1}\frac{1}{6}.$$

The reason that we simply multiply is that the results on successive tosses of the die are independent.  The die does not remember what results it has come up with in the past.

We can also get the result by using a counting argument. Imagine tossing a die $n$ times, and recording the results. So a record of $4$ tosses might read $4,5,4,1$.

There are $6^n$ possible records of the results of $n$ tosses, all equally likely.  There are $5^{n-1}$ records in which the first $n-1$ results are a non-$3$ and the last result is a $3$. So our probability is
$$\frac{5^{n-1}}{6^n}.$$

a valid passport, sometimes with pages/months free on the passport

3154,Harvesting parts from slain creatures,"In general: if you kill a monster with a body part that has some known (or suspected) property, is there any mechanic around harvesting the body part and using it as-is (or with minimal processing required)?

Specifically: We're fairly low level and just found ourselves fighting a Dretch. While none of us did very well on our knowledge checks, it became apparent during the fight that it had a fair number of buffs, including DR and elemental resistances.


Which of these are properties of the skin, and which are properties of the creature itself?
Would such properties persist in the skin after removal (and tanning, I assume)?
Would tanning/crafting produce armor, a wondrous item, a trophy, or what?


I read some comments about how his is sort of frowned upon since it disrupts the economics of the game... and, ultimately, I understand this is totally subject to DM's approval, but... just thought knowing how this is handled generally is appreciated.

(I asked another question about repurposing magic items which is somewhat similar to this, but I don't think this is a duplicate, since this is specifically about harvesting nearly-ready-to-use parts of creatures, whereas the other one dealt mainly with using magic items to create new items).
",Patrick87,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/8737,"Pathfinder, like its predecessor D&amp;D 3.5, follows careful guidelines regarding the amount of treasure awarded and the value of items with magical properties.

That means while it's up to you as DM to decide what monster body parts are worth and what items can be crafted from them, be aware that you're effectively giving out treasure.


While there are no official rules, it stands to reason that the corpse has the creature's physical properties. A red dragon's hide is still tough and fire resistant even after separated from the dragon. However, magical properties (like a displacer beast's displacement) might degrade over time unless fixed in place with enchantment.
A house rule in our 3.5 games is that the item itself may have some properties of the creature, but the item does not confer these abilities to its wielder. For example, a red dragonhide shield won't protect you from a fireball, but the next adventurer to stumble upon your charred remains will find the shield undamaged. In fact, this rule made its way into Pathfinder's rules on dragonhide armour. While the armour doesn't confer energy resistance, the price to add the energy resistance enchantment is reduced by 25%.
You can craft weapons, armour, trophies and other items from slain creatures. Here's what I suggest:


Weapons/armour: You're essentially just crafting a normal item using the creature's corpse as special materials. Make craft checks as normal, but you don't pay the raw material cost. The GM decides what special properties the material has, if any, what items can be made, and what those items cost (for the purpose of craft duration and sale price). Properties shouldn't normally be as powerful as a permanent magic enhancement (but if they are, the GM should be aware of the treasure value he's awarding every time he uses that creature).
Wondrous items: Mundane crafting isn't enough to create a permanent magic item. You need rituals to fix the magic property in place. At best, a creature's body provides a discount of up to 25% on crafting an item: e.g. a displacer beast hide to make a cloak of displacement.
Spell components: 250gp for powdered horn sounds like a great way to get rich. However, that's the buy price, so you'd sell it at 125gp, and that's after processing: as per the craft skill, raw materials are only worth 1/3 of the finished item. So at best, body parts harvested for spell components are worth a fraction of the part's price.
Trinkets: Preserved monster hearts, heads on plaques and so forth should only be worth a few gp at most. Use the craft skill as a guideline. You can normally make half your craft check per week in gold as a profession anyway, so this isn't out of bounds.



If your players try to carry back every animal part for gold, this will lead to a lot of boring bean-counting and extra gold. Remind players that their carrying capacity is limited and body parts weigh a lot. Have the market saturate and suddenly nobody wants to buy all these grell beaks. Or abstract it away: say ""you sell all the collected monster parts for 50gp"", or you can craft as a profession for double value for two weeks after you have been on an adventure where you collected parts.

5957,Structure for nitrate ion?,"

Why is the above structure not considered a valid structure for the nitrate ion? Is it because adding a double bond reduces the formal charges present on the nitrogen? Does the above form exist anywhere?
",1110101001,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/2142,"Nitrate actually exists as a superposition of these three resonance forms:



Essentially, a lone pair from an oxygen with a negative formal change forms a double bond to nitrogen. However, as nitrogen is a period II element, and hence must obey the octet rule, it can not have 5 bonds to other atoms. The already-present double bond then turns into a single bond and the pair of electrons moves onto the oxygen. This ""movement"" can happen with all three of the oxygen atoms and all three of the bonds. This is called ""resonance"".

Due to resonance, the energy of the system is minimised making it more stable.

Your Lewis structure is not far off. The ""true"" structure of nitrate is:



Approximately, each oxygen atom contributes one third of a bond with the nitrogen, lowering the formal charge on each atom from what you have written, which does not exist in nature.

The true structure is sort of an average of the properties of each possibility for where the electrons could be located, including the three resonance forms above, your structure, and any other configuration. However, these other forms are of minuscule probability to be formed (perhaps read up on wavefunctions and electron distributions if you're interested), and so the main contributors to the ""real"" structure are the three resonance forms.

Note that none of these structures ever exist in isolation for more than the most infinitesimal of time periods.

507,How to enable or disable services?,"I read about how to enable and disable services in Ubuntu and it seems that there are different possibilities to manage them.

The first method I found is update-rc.d to add new services to startup, which aims on the /etc/init.d folder and its contents.

The other one I found is to edit .conf files in the /etc/init folder.

What's the recommended way to enable / disable / add services and why?

Could you please give a short bulletproof step by step example on how to add a service in Ubuntu and enable and disable it?
",NES,https://askubuntu.com/users/7155,"Currently there are actually 2 different ways for software to be started as a service in Ubuntu. A service is defined here as a program run by the system in the background, as opposed to one started and run directly by the user.

The traditional way to start services in Linux was to place a script in /etc/init.d, and then use the update-rc.d command (or in RedHat based distros, chkconfig) to enable/disable it. This command, btw, uses some mildly complicated logic to create symlinks in /etc/rc#.d, that control the order of starting services. If you run ls /etc/rc2.d you can see the order that services will be killed (K##xxxx) and started (S##xxxx).

The issue with that was that when booting the system, everything had to be done in serial, one thing after another, making system boot times really slow. Attempts were made to parallelize this, but they were haphazard and hard to take full advantage of. This was the main reason that Upstart was created.

Upstart uses job definition files in /etc/init to define on what events a service should be started. So, while the system is booting, upstart processes various events, and then can start multiple services in parallel. This allows them to fully utilize the resources of the system, for instance, by starting a disk-bound service up while another CPU-bound service runs, or while the network is waiting for a dynamic IP address to be assigned.

You can see all of the upstart job files by running ls /etc/init/*.conf

Let me just stop here and say that if you don't know what a service is, or what it does, DO NOT disable it!

Not all services have been converted to upstart. While working on the server team at Canonical for the past few months, I've worked on a number of converted job files, and the nicest part is that it allows one to get rid of all the script ""magic"" and just put in a few commands here and there to define exactly how to start the service, and nothing more. But for now, only a handful of traditional network services, like squid and samba, have been converted.

In order to figure out if a service is upstart based, you can run the status command:

status servicename


If its an upstart job, it will show this:

$ status statd
statd start/running, process 942


But if its not, you'll see something more like this:

$ status apache2
status: Unknown job: apache2


In this case, apache2 has not been converted to upstart. So, to disable apache2 you just run

sudo update-rc.d apache2 disable
sudo service apache2 stop


Upstart job definitions do not have an update-rc.d command. To disable the job, you need to edit the job file directly to disable it. There are two ways to do this.

If you want to still be able to manually start it, then you need to comment out the 'start on' condition. Say you want to install samba, but not have it start automatically.. here is its job file (in natty):

description ""SMB/CIFS File Server""
author      ""Steve Langasek &lt;steve.langasek@ubuntu.com&gt;""

start on local-filesystems
stop on runlevel [!2345]

respawn

pre-start script
    RUN_MODE=""daemons""

    [ -r /etc/default/samba ] &amp;&amp; . /etc/default/samba

    [ ""$RUN_MODE"" = inetd ] &amp;&amp; { stop; exit 0; }

    install -o root -g root -m 755 -d /var/run/samba
end script

exec smbd -F


To disable it, you can just put a # in front of the 'start on local-filesystems'. Note that while it won't start back up on boot, you still need to stop it this time with

sudo service smbd stop


If, however, you never want it to start, I'd suggest actually removing the package. If, however, you want it installed, but not startable, you can also do:

mv /etc/init/smbd.conf /etc/init/smbd.conf.disabled


Starting with the version of upstart that will be in 11.04, there is a new keyword that disables the 'start on' and 'stop on' stanzas, it is 'manual'. So another way to disable the service as of 11.04 is to do:

command using sudo
echo 'manual' | sudo tee /etc/init/mysql.override

command from root shell
echo manual &gt;&gt; /etc/init/mysql.override


And, hopefully real soon, you will be able to create an ""override"" file to disable a service without editing the job definition at all, by just putting the 'manual' keyword in it.

The transit visa seems way cheaper than the regular visitor visa, at 28 USD, but there is a priori no procedure explained online.

The visitor visa costs 60 USD which is expensive compared with a hotel room price. According to the electronic visa website and Wikipedia, you should apply for it online and then obtain it on arrival. Note that your passport must be valid for 6 months after you leave India. You should apply between 4 and 30 days before entering India (actually the payment should be made at least 4 days in advance so i would do it early enough for the payment to be processed at least 4 days in advance) The procedure is explained there.

6854,Get latitude/longitude of friend's current_location using Graph FQL,"I'm trying to get the latitude/longitude of all of a user's friends using a single API call. I believe I need to write a multi-query FQL statement, but I can't get the syntax correct.

I believe the two queries need to be something like the following:

'""friends"":""SELECT uid,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""'

'""location"":""SELECT location FROM page WHERE id IN (SELECT current_location_id FROM #friends)""';


My problem is that somehow I need to get the ID of the current_location in the first query so that I can reference it in the second query, but I only know how to get an array that contains the id.

Thanks for any help!

Clarification:

I'm not trying to get check-ins of friends.  Instead I want to graph the ""current_location"" (i.e. where they live) of all of a user's friends on a Geo map.  I can get a user's ""current_location"" with the following FQL query:

""SELECT uid,sex,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""


This query returns the following array:

[current_location] =&gt; Array
            (
                [city] =&gt; New York
                [state] =&gt; New York
                [country] =&gt; United States
                [zip] =&gt; 
                [id] =&gt; 108424279189115
                [name] =&gt; New York, New York
            )


Which does not contain the longitude and latitude of the of the current_location (New York in the above example)

Therefore I now need to take the ID of the current_location (e.g. 108424279189115) and run a second FQL query such as:

""SELECT location,name FROM page WHERE page_id = 108424279189115)""


To get the latitude and longitude of the current_location.  Currently, I have a working code that runs the first FQL query, then extracts page_id in php, and then runs a second FQL query to get the current_location latitude/longitude.  However, for performance reasons I would like to run only one multi-query if this is possible.

The problem is that D or P are being cleared somewhere (probably when they get set as a render target), so the only sprite that ""survives"" is the last one.

Since you have all your sprites rendered to D you only need to render D onto P once.

Also it's vital that you keep up with your vehicles service intervals as described in your vehicles manuals. In my opinion there is no real science to to it. It's more or less logic and common sense. If something doesn't feel right then have it looked at by a professional that you trust as soon as possible.

Waiting on repairs only puts more wear on the other components that work with it. This usually brings repair bills through the roof and customers into ""panic"" mode. Usually ending with the customer saying ""I'll just drive it till it dies"". Which then makes their driving environment much more dangerous not only for them, but for everyone around them.

4283,House rules to make the cloister less of a game winning tile in Carcassonne?,"In my experience, cloister tiles in Carcassonne are often ""too lucky"". If you draw a cloister tile in the beginning of the game, it will typically still require an investment of quite a bit of ""meeple"" time to obtain the full 9 points, which makes it a fair trade-off. However, after about half of the game, it's relatively likely that you can ""parachute"" a cloister tile in some spot and get 8 or 9 points immediately. This adds a lot of randomness to the game.

What house rules work well to diminish this effect?
",Erik P.,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/30,"Knowing that cloisters can have this effect is half the battle.

Rather than adding a house rule to a very popular game I would advise you to alter your strategy a bit to account for future cloisters that you may not control.

Examples:


Leave a good cloister spot next to an open road that you own.  
When considering placing a tile between two relatively equal spots determine if one or the other creates a better cloister opportunity.
Keep track of how many have been played!  If you get down to 10 tiles left and 4 of them are cloisters, make sure you have the meeples available to use them.  Alternatively, keep your opponent from freeing his meeples from the board.

myinc is the domain name, it is the prefix for personal site.

* BTW, I just know 1 thing: this site collection (my site host) was migrated from another server. Here is how it was done: create web app on this new server, then export content database from the old server, then attach to the new server. after this, everything else works fine. Could it because of this?

UPDATE: This is odd. I removed all permissions, add permissions, disable self-service, then enable self-service. Then try to create the site (it is site collection, not subsite under personal site). same error messages. The setting I use is in below screen shot:


So, I played the settings, and I accidentally changed one setting: I removed the ""my/[%userid%]"" in the above screen (so it is blank). When I try to create site again, it shows this error:



I'm using a domain user account. So I think if I use a farm admin account, it should be ok? It turns out YES. It works for farm admin! So, it is because of permission! But what permission? So I removed all user permissions again, and add permissions again (just like i did before), weird thing happened: now, it works for domain user! but only for root domain http://my_host.com/ . I played more and found a more weird thing. See the 2nd screen shot, I choose the ""Prompt users to create a site collection under any managed path"" (red circle), when I click add new site, it works:



See the site collection url, http://my_host.com/my/my_test_site_collection ? I do not understand what the difference between this and the choice in the 1st screen shot (if I give it a name my_test_site_collection).

Anyone understand this? to me, I'm ok with it since I can use it (the last screen), but would like to know why it shows error in the first screen.

7527,WPF: disable bindings update on detach,"Here is the situation: I have an editor app, that edits some hierarchical data. The data itself is held in ViewModel class, and View class is responsible to reflect changes in ViewModel. The main part of the View is ContentControl. When data changes in ViewModel, a hierarchical structure of controls is (re)generated and top-level control becomes the Content of the ContentControl. Of course, those hierarchical controls have bindings.
Now it's time to close the editor. ViewModel reacts to command and clears the data. PropertyChanged is raised and the View is ready to react: it attempts to do

myContentControl.Content = null;


But this is where the pitfall is: WPF detaches hieararchy of controls from ContentControl's visual tree and re-evaluates bindings. But the data is already destroyed! 

What should I do? Why WPF updates bindings on controls that go out of visual tree? Of course I can do additional check for nulls, but is there a way not to do binding at all on half-dead controls?

Therefore, when editing starts you copy the fields from the current object to the editable properties in the view model. We then leave the user to edit what they want. If they cancel the operation, then we do nothing, as the original object is untouched.

However, if they want to save, then we copy the properties from the edited view model to the original object and save it. Then the view and view model can be disposed of without consequence.

2233,Show tooltip on invalid input in edit control,"I have subclassed edit control to accept only floating numbers. I would like to pop a tooltip when user makes an invalid input. The behavior I target is like the one edit control with ES_NUMBER has :



So far I was able to implement tracking tooltip and display it when user makes invalid input.

However, the tooltip is misplaced. I have tried to use ScreenToClient and ClientToScreen to fix this but have failed.

Here are the instructions for creating SCCE :

1) Create default Win32 project in Visual Studio.

2) Add the following includes in your stdafx.h, just under #include &lt;windows.h&gt; :

#include &lt;windowsx.h&gt;
#include &lt;commctrl.h&gt;

#pragma comment( lib, ""comctl32.lib"")

#pragma comment(linker, \
    ""\""/manifestdependency:type='Win32' ""\
    ""name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' ""\
    ""version='6.0.0.0' ""\
    ""processorArchitecture='*' ""\
    ""publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' ""\
    ""language='*'\"""")


3) Add these global variables:

HWND g_hwndTT;
TOOLINFO g_ti;


4) Here is a simple subclass procedure for edit controls ( just for testing purposes ) :

LRESULT CALLBACK EditSubProc ( HWND hwnd, UINT message, 
    WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam, 
    UINT_PTR uIdSubclass, DWORD_PTR dwRefData )
{
    switch (message)
    {
    case WM_CHAR:
        {
            POINT pt;
            if( ! isdigit( wParam ) )  // if not a number pop a tooltip!
            {
                if (GetCaretPos(&amp;pt))  // here comes the problem
                {
                    // coordinates are not good, so tooltip is misplaced
                    ClientToScreen( hwnd, &amp;pt );


                    /************************** EDIT #1 ****************************/
                    /******* If I delete this line x-coordinate is OK *************/
                    /*** y-coordinate should be little lower, but it is still OK **/
                    /**************************************************************/

                    ScreenToClient( GetParent(hwnd), &amp;pt );

                    /************************* Edit #2 ****************************/

                    // this adjusts the y-coordinate, see the second edit
                    RECT rcClientRect;
                    Edit_GetRect( hwnd, &amp;rcClientRect );
                    pt.y = rcClientRect.bottom;

                    /**************************************************************/

                    SendMessage(g_hwndTT, TTM_TRACKACTIVATE, 
                        TRUE, (LPARAM)&amp;g_ti);
                    SendMessage(g_hwndTT, TTM_TRACKPOSITION, 
                        0, MAKELPARAM(pt.x, pt.y));
                }
                return FALSE;
            }
            else
            {
                SendMessage(g_hwndTT, TTM_TRACKACTIVATE, 
                    FALSE, (LPARAM)&amp;g_ti);
                return ::DefSubclassProc( hwnd, message, wParam, lParam );
            }
        }
        break;
    case WM_NCDESTROY:
        ::RemoveWindowSubclass( hwnd, EditSubProc, 0 );
        return DefSubclassProc( hwnd, message, wParam, lParam);
        break;
    }
    return DefSubclassProc( hwnd, message, wParam, lParam);
} 


5) Add the following WM_CREATE handler :

case WM_CREATE:
    {
        HWND hEdit = CreateWindowEx( 0, L""EDIT"", L""edit"", WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE |
            WS_BORDER | ES_CENTER, 150, 150, 100, 30, hWnd, (HMENU)1000, hInst, 0 );

        // try with tooltip
        g_hwndTT = CreateWindow(TOOLTIPS_CLASS, NULL,
            WS_POPUP | TTS_ALWAYSTIP | TTS_BALLOON,
            0, 0, 0, 0, hWnd, NULL, hInst, NULL);

        if( !g_hwndTT )
            MessageBeep(0);  // just to signal error somehow

        g_ti.cbSize = sizeof(TOOLINFO);
        g_ti.uFlags = TTF_TRACK | TTF_ABSOLUTE;
        g_ti.hwnd = hWnd;
        g_ti.hinst = hInst;
        g_ti.lpszText = TEXT(""Hi there"");

        if( ! SendMessage(g_hwndTT, TTM_ADDTOOL, 0, (LPARAM)&amp;g_ti) )
            MessageBeep(0);  // just to have some error signal

        // subclass edit control
        SetWindowSubclass( hEdit, EditSubProc, 0, 0 );
    }
    return 0L;  


6) Initialize common controls in MyRegisterClass ( before return statement ) :

// initialize common controls
INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX iccex;
iccex.dwSize = sizeof(INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX);
iccex.dwICC = ICC_BAR_CLASSES | ICC_WIN95_CLASSES | 
    ICC_TAB_CLASSES | ICC_TREEVIEW_CLASSES | ICC_STANDARD_CLASSES ;

if( !InitCommonControlsEx(&amp;iccex) ) 
    MessageBeep(0);   // signal error 


That's it, for the SSCCE.

My questions are following :


How can I properly position tooltip in my main window? How should I manipulate with caret coordinates?
Is there a way for tooltip handle and toolinfo structure to not be global?


Thank you for your time.

Best regards. 

EDIT #1:

I have managed to achieve quite an improvement by deleting ScreenToClient call in the subclass procedure. The x-coordinate is good, y-coordinate could be slightly lower. I still would like to remove global variables somehow...

EDIT #2:

I was able to adjust y-coordinate by using EM_GETRECT message and setting y-coordinate to the bottom of the formatting rectangle:

RECT rcClientRect;
Edit_GetRect( hwnd, &amp;rcClientRect );
pt.y = rcClient.bottom;


Now the end-result is much better. All that is left is to remove global variables...

EDIT #3:

It seems that I have cracked it! The solution is in EM_SHOWBALLOONTIP and EM_HIDEBALLOONTIP messages! Tooltip is placed at the caret position, ballon shape is the same as the one on the picture, and it auto-dismisses itself properly. And the best thing is that I do not need global variables!

Here is my subclass procedure snippet:

case WM_CHAR:
{
    // whatever... This condition is for testing purpose only
    if( ! IsCharAlpha( wParam ) &amp;&amp; IsCharAlphaNumeric( wParam ) )
    {
        SendMessage(hwnd, EM_HIDEBALLOONTIP, 0, 0);
        return ::DefSubclassProc( hwnd, message, wParam, lParam );
    }
    else
    {
        EDITBALLOONTIP ebt;

        ebt.cbStruct = sizeof( EDITBALLOONTIP );
        ebt.pszText = L"" Tooltip text! "";
        ebt.pszTitle = L"" Tooltip title!!! "";
        ebt.ttiIcon = TTI_ERROR_LARGE;    // tooltip icon

        SendMessage(hwnd, EM_SHOWBALLOONTIP, 0, (LPARAM)&amp;ebt);

        return FALSE;
    }
 }
 break;

",AlwaysLearningNewStuff,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2676466,"After further testing, I have decided to put this as an answer so others can clearly spot it. 

The solution is in using EM_SHOWBALLOONTIP and EM_HIDEBALLOONTIP messages. You do not need to create tooltip and associate it to an edit control! Therefore, all I need to do now is simply subclass edit control and everything works :

LRESULT CALLBACK EditSubProc ( HWND hwnd, UINT message, 
WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam, 
UINT_PTR uIdSubclass, DWORD_PTR dwRefData )
{
    switch (message)
    {
    case WM_CHAR:
        {
            if( ! isdigit( wParam ) )  // if not a number pop a tooltip!
            {
                EDITBALLOONTIP ebt;

                ebt.cbStruct = sizeof( EDITBALLOONTIP );
                ebt.pszText = L"" Tooltip text! "";
                ebt.pszTitle = L"" Tooltip title!!! "";
                ebt.ttiIcon = TTI_ERROR_LARGE;    // tooltip icon

                SendMessage(hwnd, EM_SHOWBALLOONTIP, 0, (LPARAM)&amp;ebt);
                return FALSE;
            }
            else
            {
                SendMessage(hwnd, EM_HIDEBALLOONTIP, 0, 0);
                return ::DefSubclassProc( hwnd, message, wParam, lParam );
            }
        }
        break;
    case WM_NCDESTROY:
        ::RemoveWindowSubclass( hwnd, EditSubProc, 0 );
        return DefSubclassProc( hwnd, message, wParam, lParam);
        break;
    }
    return DefSubclassProc( hwnd, message, wParam, lParam);
} 


That's it!

Hopefully this answer will help someone too!

4565,Career advice – mathematics,"I really need some opinions/advice on my situation.

My background

I'm studying for my master degree in mathematics. I have always (since I was 14) wanted to do my own research one day. As I grew older, I knew that mathematics was what I wanted to do. So I went to the university to study mathematics. After having encountered a course in group theory I knew that I belonged to the algebraic part of mathematics. I did my bachelor project in group theory and when I became a graduate student (September 2013), I took courses and made a project supporting my interest in algebra.

Along the way I created the vision that I would finish my master degree as a dedicated student in algebra. In order to realize this vision my plan was to study abroad for one semester taking new algebraic courses.

The situation

My situation today is that my study abroad semester begins tomorrow. As mentioned my dream is to do my own research, but more generally/important: I want to develop new ideas and be dedicated to something and I would love to follow/explore my passion.

My first thought (as many other students): I should get a PhD. So I did some research and figured out that there was an available position at the university I'm currently studying at in geometric group theory.

I don't know much about geometric group theory, but I do know that I love group theory. So I would really like to know if this is an opportunity or if I should just forget it.

I don't want to pursue a PhD for anything in this world. I just want to stay focus on creating a meaningful work life around my passion.

Any advice?



Further remarks

I'm a student from Denmark and I'm studying abroad in Austria for one semester. After my study abroad semester I still have to study one year for my master degree in Denmark. However this year consists of a half year with elective courses and a half year where I'm making my master's thesis. 

I don’t know much about the PhD position. I found it from a Google search (: “PhD position group theory”). There is only given a starting date and an e-mail address for contact. I’m going to attend a course held by the supervisor of the project, so the whole thing is a coincidence. 

I have investigated my opportunities for a position at my home university. One of my supervisors, a professor in group theory, told me that he couldn't offer me a position, since it was a question about money, but would like to recommend me. I don't think the university accepts PhD students without a master degree and the positions are without project descriptions.

However there is also another university (in Denmark) with a talent program where it is possible to get a PhD position without having a master degree. I contacted them and they told me I should apply after my study abroad semester (because I would have a stronger profile). But I don't know my chances.
",HelloProfile,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/12557,"I'm having a lot of trouble nailing down your question.  After reading it several times, I think you mean that you have an opportunity to go on to study a PhD in geometric group theory at your current university.  (Is it specifically relevant that you are going abroad tomorrow?  How does this fit in with the rest?)  From this I am guessing that you are not in the US, because in the US one would not have a position in ""geometric group theory"" specifically; one would just apply to the entire math department.  It could be helpful to know what country you are studying in.

So I think you are really asking whether you should go on to do a PhD?  You say that your motivation is to do mathematical research: for that you essentially need a PhD, yes.  


  Along the way I created the vision that I would finish my master degree as a dedicated student in algebra.


Yes, okay, you're studying algebra.  I feel like I'm missing some nuance here: what's the ""vision""?


  As mentioned my dream is to do my own research, but more generally/important: I want to develop new ideas and be dedicated to something and I would love to follow/explore my passion.


Again, I feel like I'm missing a nuance.  Doing your own research means precisely to developing your new ideas and being dedicated to something.  Doesn't everyone want to ""follow/explore their passion""?  That comes off sounding mean, which is not my intent: rather, I feel like you're trying to say something here and I'm missing it.


  I don't know much about geometric group theory, but I do know that I love group theory. So I would really like to know if this is an opportunity or if I should just forget it.


It seems clear that a PhD in geometric group theory is an indeed an opportunity to do everything that you said you wanted to do...in geometric group theory, which is a subfield of the field that you say you like.  Whether you will like GGT specifically seems best answered by learning some and finding out.  If the PhD program is so specifically invested in GGT that if you find out you don't want to do GGT per se then you'll need to leave the program, then you should study GGT on your own / during your master's degree first in order to find out whether it's interesting enough to you to spend years of your life on.  (I think GGT is really interesting.  If I hadn't done arithmetic geometry, I think I would have had fun with it.  So I assure you that there is nothing wrong with that subsubfield of mathematics!)


  I don't want to pursue a PhD for anything in this world. I just want to stay focus on creating a meaningful work life around my passion.

5178,Do Cron_schedule table collects log cleaning status too?,"Hi If magento fails to run the log cleaning process as per the configuration then where it does saves the error_log (or) failure status? Magento doesn't clean the log tables periodically.

Note: I can't set Cron from cpanel(WHM) to do this automatically, as I don't have option.

Any help will be appreciated 

Thanks
",Dev,https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/4399,"If you cannot set up a cron job to run Magento's cron trigger (either cron.sh or cron.php) regularly, then Magento's internal cron jobs don't run. 

If your hosting provider won't let you run cron jobs, then you will have to call cron.php periodically by calling it remotely with curl or wget.

Two things to finish out the setup:


you must run cron.php at least every 15 minutes minimum so you don't get ""too late for the schedule"" because the job got set but didn't run within the expiry time period. Magento cron jobs are a two step process, the job gets set on the first trigger (scheduled), then then on next trigger, it gets run (at about the scheduled time after the nearest trigger runtime)
you must go to System->Config->Advanced->System to complete the Log Cleaning setup.




Generate schedule information (System->Config->Advanced->System) under the Cron windowshade for a system that's running cron.sh/cron.php every 15 minutes. 

Note: AOE_Scheduler is being run on this system and the extra fields are there for it. If you're running AOE_Scheduler and you're running a cron trigger (cron.php) every 15 minutes, you need to set the AOE_Scheduler Heartbeat Task Schedule appropriately to be every 15 minutes.

5726,What's a common mechanism for emailing in the background?,"When users sign up to my site, the connection from my server to our 3rd-party SMTP provider is very bad and the app takes from a few seconds to a few minutes to connect. While it is trying to connect and send, users are forced to wait there and sometimes they would just give up and leave the site.

This is horrible user experience. What is a good way to make this seem instantaneous (having to host our own mailserver is not an option at this point)? Some way to execute this in the background? Maybe using some type of queuing mechanism?

I'm using the LNAMP stack on a CentOS 5 x64 machine. App is using CodeIgniter.

EDIT:

It seems using a local mailserver to use as a relay is a common solution. But how does one log or track whether or not email was delivered correctly by using this method? 

Sidenote: Some ESPs provide a REST API for email delivery (ours do too). We currently use SMTP and not their REST API. 
",lamp_scaler,https://serverfault.com/users/87326,"Not sure how common it (good practise) is but sending an email is a typical asynchronous process. One that can take several seconds and beyond. This makes it a perfect candidate for the use of messaging queue. 

The delivery method is of secondary importance but third party providers such as SendGrid (for transactional emails - forgotten password, invoice etc) or MailChimp (for newsletters and marketing) offer good value and has proven reliable.

By messaging queue I mean RabbitMQ (AMQ), ZeroMQ, Gearman, AWS SQS etc
Those can be used for any sort of information exchange between applications. In this case it's an information that certain email needs sending.

In terms of delivery information this can be obtained through an API with such provider or with more expensive plans through callback.

For example, in my field it's sometimes the case that someone sketches a proof idea in a conference paper without a full version, and fleshing this out requires some clarification from the authors. 

Of course, you can always add in a question from your list as extra cargo. Then it's a little more likely that someone will reply.

  A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the characters maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the characters Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total.

Paracetamol

I doubt there is much of a placebo effect at work, since most of these either did or did not work when I first took them, without having expectations either way.

Whenever I have a head ache, I take an APC. I suspect it's actually the aspirin in there that does the job, since when I take just paracetamol, it doesn't do squat. As a kid I got children's aspirin, which worked.

I once had a severe back ache. I was prescribed diclofenac (a heavier variant than the over the counter one), which didn't work. I was then prescribed tramadol &mdash; same results. I then tried naproxen, which worked rightaway.

Why do some pain killers work while others don't?

Is there an underlying mechanism, that explains why some of these work while others don't? Does that predict if pain killers that I haven't used yet will work?

Please note that I'm not looking for medical advice on which pain killers to take; I'm just curious about how my body interacts with the various ones.

",SQB,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6800,"Short answer: different people have different amount of active receptors. 
In treatment, combination scores of Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics determine the final effect of the drug. 
Receptors determine many effects of the drug in many pathways. 
Different people also sense pains differently (Psychology). 

Review answer

The purpose of treatment is to relieve pain and maintain function. 
Your question is biased. 
You cannot only concentrate on painkilling in maintaining health. 
These both are the reasons for the complains of the patient, not only the pain.

For instance, in rheumatoid arthritis, response to therapy can be quantitated using many measures including American College of Rheumatology system values ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70, which denotes the percentage of patients showing an improvement of 20%, 50% or 70% in a global assessment of signs (maintaining function) and symptoms (pains).

Each patient has own health, different from one another. 
Our body adapts to the environment and individual conditions of the body to maintain homeostasis. 
Receptors adapt for instance. 
They can be active or inactive - in short-run and long-run - again depending on the conditions at hand. 

Painkillers i.e. analgesics have different properties:


anti-inflammatory effect - acute and chronic conditions (inflammation is the major mechanism under many pathologies) e.g. nonsteiroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, please, see this answer about the particular mechanisms and how different people have different effects from NSAID painkillers) and glucocorticoids (most) 
symptoms relieving specific drugs e.g. disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
anti-platelet effect - e.g. the older you get, the more platelets stick together.
anti-pyretic effect
...


which all can be toxic. 
Note that many drugs alone or/and as combination can work as painkillers i.e. pain relievers. 
Aspirin for instance has both anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet properties. 
However, it is rarely anymore used as anti-inflammatory. 
The anti-platelet property is dependent on the exact dosage of the administration. 
Aspirin's mechanism of action is to inhibit platelet COX which antiplatelet effect lasts 8-10 days (life of the platelet). 
In other tissues, synthesis of new COX replaces the inactivated enzyme so that ordinary doses have a duration of 6-12 hours.

Each these drug has own Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics


Pharmacodynamics answers to the question What drug does to the body? It stimulates some receptors, activates some pathways, ...
Pharmacokinetics - What does body do to the drug? It metabolises it (enzymes, receptors). It distributes it. It excretes it (kidneys, feaces).  


In treatment, you consider what is the target organ. 
You need to think what is causing the dysfunction and the pain. 
You try to restore the function and relieve pain. 
The component of drug needs to reach the target tissue e.g. your pancreas' beta cells do no produce insulin so your blood glucose is high. 
Complications of this are polyuria and eventually exodus if untreated. 
Insulin is injected into the fatty tissue. 
We do not have long-term acting insulin administered orally - our metabolism start to break the drug so it does not have wanted treatment. 
If insulin administered to the muscle, the time of action is too times less, again because muscle is metabolising the insulin i.e. a chain of peptides (protein).

No all symptoms and diseases have painkillers. 
For instance, prehemorrhoid and some types of itching related to  posthemorrhoids. 
However, for both, there are some special salvas for proplylaxis but they are not complete.

Now, you can start to read something in SuperBest's answer about host's physiological variables and addiction/tolerance which alters the mechanisms (receptors) of pathways in Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics.

3586,Is it possible to get a popup to ignore MenuDropAlignment in a WPF / Touch app?,"As a bit of background - Windows has a facility for Touch/TabletPCs whereby it shifts the position of popups/menus depending on your ""handedness"" (to prevent the menu appearing under your hand). 

Essentially what this does is if you are set to ""right handed"" (which it seems to default to once you've connected a touch device), every popup you open is artificially kicked to the left - this causes massive layout issues where we try and line up a popup with the item it ""popped up from"" :

Tablet PC Settings set to Left handed - no artificial correction from Windows


Tablet PC Settings set to Right handed - Windows artificially adjusts our positioning


We can detect what this setting is set to with SystemParameters.MenuDropAlignment, and for trivial popups we can adjust this using the actual width of the popup - but for dynamic popups and when we throw right to left support into the mix, this just doesn't work.

Currently it's looking more likely that we are going to have to go through every popup, manually work out a value to adjust the kick, and add something like this to every one:

&lt;MultiDataTrigger&gt;
    &lt;MultiDataTrigger.Conditions&gt;
        &lt;Condition Binding=""{Binding Source={x:Static SystemParameters.MenuDropAlignment}}"" Value=""True""/&gt;
        &lt;Condition Binding=""{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource Mode=Self}, Path=FlowDirection}"" Value=""RightToLeft""/&gt;
    &lt;/MultiDataTrigger.Conditions&gt;
    &lt;MultiDataTrigger.Setters&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""HorizontalOffset"" Value=""-50""/&gt; &lt;!-- Set to arbitrary value to test --&gt;
    &lt;/MultiDataTrigger.Setters&gt;
&lt;/MultiDataTrigger&gt;


So.. back to the question :-) Does anyone know of a way to stop a WPF popup looking at this setting at all? 

For those that don't have a touch device you can access the Tablet PC settings by running:

C:\Windows\explorer.exe shell:::{80F3F1D5-FECA-45F3-BC32-752C152E456E}

8091,System for Setting: Misfits,"On the recommendation of one of my players, I'm watching Misfits, a British TV show about kids (Their ages aren't so far specifically stated; they're old enough to drink and young enough to live at home, so late-teens to early 20s, I guess) serving community-service sentences who get super powers. The recommendation included an explicit desire for me to run a game like this.

I'm watching it and thinking about what system to run it in. I want to ask this question more clearly than my last system-for-setting question, so here are some specific points to consider when answering:

WARNING! Spoilers Below!

If you haven't watched the series but plan to, you might not want to read what follows. I tried to separate setting spoilers from the system requirements, but it just didn't work.


The world is gritty and the power level is relatively low. It reminded me of Wild Cards, with ""the storm"" as the catalyzing event. Therefore, the system must support fine gradations in power - the scale is pretty low, so a small advantage needs to be representable.
Powers are uncontrollable - at least at first. Alisha's lust-inspiring power is uncontrolled as far as I have watched, and the immortality power (obviously) works without conscious effort. Curtis' time rewind is a power of huge significance, but it's not controlled by the beginning of the second season either. Therefore the system must support uncontrolled and unreliable powers.
The system you recommend must support regular humans as significant combat threats - Sally gave Simon a real fight. Player character death must be a real possibility.
This is also an ensemble drama, like Buffy, and much of the story is about the changing relationships between the characters.


When answering, please include only one system per answer to facilitate voting.

In your answer please address the following:


How that system fits the given criteria

  Some professors and other interviewers have asked me where else I have interviewed. Should I tell interviewers where else I've interviewed?


Yes, it is very likely in your best interests.  If you have other interviews at comparable schools, then you will benefit from saying so.  If you don't, then it's not so clear.  However, departments will assume your job search is not going well if you are reluctant to address the issue and they haven't heard impressive rumors about your interviews, so avoiding discussing interviews won't really help.  Instead of saying something awkward like ""I'd rather not talk about that"", it's better to be up front and optimistic.  ""This is my first interview"" is better than ""This is my only interview so far"".

Here are a few reasons why telling about other interviews can help your case:


As a general rule, people want something more if they know other people also want it.  Valuing a second opinion is rational behavior.
Even when it doesn't change the outcome, competition can speed things up.  If a search committee member is trying to make an offer and still needs some final committee or administrative approval, it's helpful to be able to say ""Let's move fast, since she is also interviewing at X, Y, and Z, and we'd like to make a good impression by coming up with the first offer.""  If it's too late for that, they can say ""She already has an offer from X, so we need to act before she decides.""


In principle, you could hurt your chances if you list a lot of schools typically considered much more desirable (which could make the school you are currently interviewing at feel they would just be wasting their time trying to compete).  However, in this case you are probably already in trouble, since the rumors of your busy interview schedule may already worry the search committee.  Instead of trying to cover things up, it's better to acknowledge that you have these other interviews.  If you are worried about this risk, you can address it by making your interest clear throughout the interview.

1904,House rules to make the cloister less of a game winning tile in Carcassonne?,"In my experience, cloister tiles in Carcassonne are often ""too lucky"". If you draw a cloister tile in the beginning of the game, it will typically still require an investment of quite a bit of ""meeple"" time to obtain the full 9 points, which makes it a fair trade-off. However, after about half of the game, it's relatively likely that you can ""parachute"" a cloister tile in some spot and get 8 or 9 points immediately. This adds a lot of randomness to the game.

What house rules work well to diminish this effect?
",Erik P.,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/30,"There are a couple of expansions that reduce the usefulness of cloisters. You don't get the points until all the surrounding squares are filled, which is a safe bet in 'vanilla' Carcassonne, but not such a sure thing with expansions. The Tower expansion makes it less attractive to leave meeple on the board for any length of time, because they are sitting ducks for capture by a tower. The Catapult expansion makes it possible to remove Meeple from the board, or replace them with your own. The Princess and the Dragon expansion also encourages Monk removal as dragon-food.

You could ban the 'instant cloister' case, disallowing the dropping of a cloister into a hole for an immediate 9 points. I personally don't find this a huge problem though. You have equivalent 'instant city' and 'instant road' cases. Ultimately, there is quite a lot of luck involved in Carcassonne, by design, I think.

4438,Effects of nuclear explosions in space?,"In the Honor Harrington universe, ship-to-ship combat takes two forms: missiles and direct energy weapons.

Missiles come in two forms - bomb-pumped lasers and contact nukes.  Both use multi-megaton nuclear initiations to damage enemy ships.

While this sort of event on a planetary surface will obviously have lasting effects, what long-term effects could be expected in a vacuum environment, aside from the destructive force associated with the explosions themselves, and the resulting EMP?  Especially, would there be lingering (or spreading) radiation?
",Jeff,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/656,"Compared to everyday celestial events, the energy of an H-bomb is laughably tiny. The sun is something like a billion H-bombs per second. A gamma ray burst may be a billion-billion times that. So anything humans can construct is like an single ant (not a colony) attacking mount Everest (or if you want to compare to a gammaray burst a single virus attacking the enture mountain range). It just won't be noticable except in a small local area. The one thing a nuke does that is different, is generate fission products, which for the most part aren't found in space (although other radioactive isotops yes). And even these isotopes, are probably generated in much greater volume by supernovas, but unless you are in the neighborhood of a recently exploded one, they have long since decayed away.

The earth based space tests, were significant, because they happened in the very rarified earths exosphere/magnetosphere, and generated high energy particles (mostly electrons), trapped in the earths radiation belts. At the time it was feared we might have to wait decades for the activity to settle down to the undisturbed state.

2654,Using limits to prove a function is in the order of another function,"I have to prove the following theorem:



I am not asking for the whole problem, but am stuck on the first part (Proving that output of c implies g(n) is in the order of f(n)).

I know the following:


  The order of f(n) is the set of complexity functions g(n) for which there exists some positive real constants c and d and some nonnegative integer N such that, for all n >= N:
  $c * f(n) &lt;= g(n) &lt;= d * f(n)$


At this point, I feel that I may be able to use induction with the formula above to show that the limit of g(n)/f(n) is nonnegative, but I can't quite wrap my head around that. Or perhaps there is another way to show that the limit converges?
",AdamMc331,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/193080,"$$\lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{g(n)}{f(n)}=c$$ 
means that $\forall \epsilon&gt;0, \exists n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n \geq n_0:$
$$\left |\frac{g(n)}{f(n)}-c \right | &lt; \epsilon \Rightarrow - \epsilon&lt; \frac{g(n)}{f(n)}-c&lt; \epsilon \Rightarrow c- \epsilon&lt; \frac{g(n)}{f(n)}&lt;c+\epsilon \\ \Rightarrow (c-\epsilon)f(n)&lt; g(n)&lt;(c+\epsilon) f(n)$$

We pick $\epsilon=\frac{c}{2}$ and we have that $\forall n \geq n_0:$

$$\frac{c}{2} \cdot f(n)&lt; g(n)&lt; \frac{3c}{2} \cdot f(n)$$

Now pick $c_1=\frac{c}{2}, c_2=\frac{3c}{2}$ and you will see that this is the definition of $g(n)=\Theta(f(n))$.

2954,Custom key binding/mapping,"Currently I am starting to develop my first serious game. Before the games are all training, and learning how to do things in a good way. Unfortunatly, I've missed a big part in my preparation: Key binding. 

Currently I am trying to figure out how I can bind keys to action for each scene in my game.
For example:
If the user presses the JumpButton during the GameScene, the avatar should jump, but pressing the same key in a MenuScene, the currently selected menuitem should be activated.

Which key the JumpButton is, should the user be able to set. But the behaviour should be always the same. 

Here is my first, and I think very naviive idea:

I am having a HashMap with HashMap where Key is the key on the Keyboard and ACTION is just an enumValue.
When I am in the scene, and a button is pressed, I will take that button, and ask the HashMap which action is bind to the button. using a switch I can now determine what to do.
In my mind there is a little gap.. I have ONE action per Button, maybe named: ACTION_PLAYER_JUMP as an enumValue, and when I am in a GameScene this is okay, but in a MenuScene this ACTION_PLAYER_JUMP is not a very nice name... I do not want to have all bindings two times, just for better names.

Can someone tell me how to fix this, or a better system? I am sure there is a much better system for handling those bindings.
",glethien,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/20379,"Your mapping strategy sounds like it'll work great. The problem you really need to solve is having pretty display names for your enum values.

See this question and answer on SO.

Essentially, you can switch from a enum or you can use C# properties to save and display additional information about each enum value.

Using either option, your dictionary is still going to use some kind of key mapping from a key code to an action. The dictionary is an ideal data structure for this kind of operation.

focus on a really close subject
use the longest possible focal length (and shoot at the widest aperture)
use a really fast prime lens

Now, how to highlight EVERY equivalent child in the column....

I know I need to do something with .each(), but I'm unsure where to put it...
",Nicholas Hazel,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2275042,"To add a class for an entire column use td:nth-child(n) where n is the column number.  In your case, the columns you want to highlight vary from 2-4.  You also need to prevent the head, foot, etc. elements from being highlighted, so use .not().

$('table#prices tbody td:nth-child(3)')
  .not('.head,.price,.foot,.category_hover')
  .addClass('vertFilt');


So, for your situation, try this:

$('tr.catTr td').not('.category').hover(function(){

    var priceSel = $(this).index();

    $('table#prices tbody td:nth-child('+priceSel+')')
      .not('.head,.price,.foot,.category_hover')
      .addClass('vertFilt');

    ...

},function(){

    var priceSel = $(this).index();

    $('table#prices tbody td:nth-child('+priceSel+')')

If we connect 1.5V cell to a 10 ohm resistor, the current is, by Ohm's law, 0.15A and the power delivered to the resistor by the cell is 0.225W.

Now, connect a 9V battery in place of the 1.5V cell.  The current is now, by Ohm's law, 0.9A and the power delivered to the resistor is now 8.1W.

The 9V battery must deliver far more power to the resistor than the 1.5V cell does.

",Dimensionless,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/9023,"The effect would be less than that of the weather, or even large earthquakes.

By “earth’s course” you could mean earth’s orbit around the sun, the earth’s rate of rotation about its own axis, and the orientation of the earth’s axis relative to distant stars.

Any process that involves the redistribution of mass can affect the motion of the earth – an earthquake, a volcanic eruption, seasonal weather, ocean currents, or driving your car.  Although the effect can be calculated, the redistribution of mass by driving your car would much too small to measure using present technology.  The most advanced methods of measuring earth orientation were required to detect that the great 2011 Japan Quake shortened the length-of-day and moved the earth’s axis.  The effect of a volcanic eruption has not yet been measured.  Because a volcanic eruption would redistribute relatively less mass, the calculated effect of the event upon the oblateness and moment of inertia of the earth would be less than an earthquake and much less than seasonal weather.

The formation of a shield volcano the size of the Olympus Mons (on Mars) on Earth would change the Earth’s rotation from what it is presently.  The distribution of mass associated with the Yellowstone hotspot contributes to the Earth’s present moment of inertia.

Proof with complete induction. Please please help me, because I have exams coming up (I am just becoming a primary school teacher..)


  For $n\in\mathbb{N}$:
  
  $$\sum^n_{i=1}\frac{1}{(2i-1)(2i+1)}=\frac{n}{2n+1}$$

",Sophia,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/63169,"For a full solution, proceed like this:  

$n=1$: $$\sum_{i=1}^1 \frac{1}{(2i-1)(2i+1)} = \frac{1}{(2-1)(2+1)} = \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2 \cdot 1 +1},$$
so it holds for $n=1$.  

Assume next that it holds for some generic $n$. You need to show that then it also holds for $n+1$. As it holds for $n$, you can assume that
$$\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{(2i-1)(2i+1)} = \frac{n}{2n+1}. \quad (1),$$
and want to show that
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \frac{1}{(2i-1)(2i+1)} = \frac{n+1}{2(n+1)+1}. \quad (2)$$
Then:
$$\begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \frac{1}{(2i-1)(2i+1} &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{(2i-1)(2i+1)} + \frac{1}{(2(n+1)-1)(2(n+1)+1)} \\
&amp; = \frac{n}{2n+1} + \frac{1}{(2n+1)(2n+3)} \quad \text{using (1)} \\
&amp; = \frac{n(2n+3)}{(2n+1)(2n+3)} + \frac{1}{(2n+1)(2n+3)} \\
&amp; = \frac{2n^2 +3n +1}{(2n+1)(2n+3)} \\ 
&amp; = \frac{(n+1)(2n+1)}{(2n+1)(2n+3)} = \frac{n+1}{2(n+1)+1},\\

which is (2), and

",mister why,https://stackoverflow.com/users/685664,"While C++ lambdas are strictly monomorphic, they are merely shorthand for function objects (aka functors), and in general functors can be polymorphic; i.e., their call operators can be overloaded or templated. As a result, functors (and, consequently, lambdas) are never implicitly convertible to templated std::function&lt;&gt; (or boost::function&lt;&gt;) instances because functors' operator() argument types are not automatically inferable.

To phrase it slightly differently, the natural type of your lambda expression is a functor with a parameterless constructor and an operator() with the signature void operator ()(int) const. However obvious this fact may be to you and I, it's not automatically inferrable that ArgT should resolve to int because lambdas are functors and functors' operator()s are possible to overload and template.

TL;DR: What you want isn't possible.

The user now can select a node to add to product 2 or go 1 level deeper into the navigation 3. and 4.. If you click on a node-link the children off that node will slide-in and stack on top of the current menu. There is also a back option to parent (second wireframe).

I deliberately chose checkboxes, links and button as elements because that's their purpose; I wireframed there functionality not a design-solution. Normally I like selecting text/label also checks a checkbox, but now the label is a link too. A user could a) select that node to add to product, Or b) select node to navigate to children of that node.





I could argue if it makes sense that a node will act is a leaf and a branch. A don't have any real data about how customers assign nodes. I can't wait for this input. Currently functionality of the system is that a node could be a leaf and a branch. So asking real users is no option. Maybe in the future (months from now).

How to convert this into an intuitive navigation?
",myradon,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/41645,"Is there a relationship between selecting a node and selecting its parent node?

For example, if Node A has child nodes B, C and D, is it the case that selecting all of B,C and D implicitly selects A and vice versa?  If so, then you don't necessarily need different click behaviors for leaf and branch nodes.  Perhaps the first click on ""Node A"" expands it, and subsequent clicks select / deselect it (and all its children); and if B, C and D are each checked individually then A is checked automatically.  You would still need a separate button / triangle to collapse the list, but that functionality is much less important, especially if the list is only on screen transiently.

I am thinking here of the hierarchical checkbox lists you sometimes see in older Windows installer applications.  You get a list of features, with a checkbox next to each, and if the feature has sub-features of which only some are selected, its checkbox shows a special intermediate state.  I don't recall which installer type does this, and it's not brilliantly implemented anyway, but the basic idea can work well I think.

I know i can easily do a validation using ant to cut down the validation time but unfortunately the end user team does not allow this.Is there anything we can do to cut down the time taken to do the validate task for changesets in the production org?
Buyan
",buyan kumar,https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/2252,"Changeset deployment usually does not have SLA and what you have  experienced is an expected behavior. Deployment time will always vary and how long one deployment takes to complete does not become a benchmark on how long it'll take to complete another 

There are times when changeset deployment will hit a legitimate issue such as gack or a lock and when those occur, Salesforce support can definitely investigate and escalate to have the issue rectified. However in few cases the deployment doesn't hit any gack or lock.

If it took this long to complete may possibly be link to the the many post release patches Salesforce.com have been rolling out, as when a patch goes out active requests like changesets are temporary put on hold and resumed when ready, other possible causes of extended deployment time are size/types of component being deploy and how it affect/changes the org, heavy traffic on the instance or simply multiple deployment / validation holding up the total overall deployment process in the org. 

However we need to remember there are no SLA with changeset, but if you want to deploy quicker and have more control over their deployment, then IDE / ANT is the way to go.

    cout &lt;&lt; ""Stack Top is: "" &lt;&lt; aStack.peek() &lt;&lt; endl;

    return 0;
}


The code is compiling and running correctly, this is standard output:

Stack is empty, you must PUSH an element before POPping one! 
Popped Element: -1 
Stack Top is: 1 
Stack Top is: 2 
Stack Top is: 3 
Stack is full, you must POP an element before PUSHing a new one! 
Stack Top is: 3 
Popped Element: 3 
Stack Top is: 2 
Popped Element: 2 
Stack Top is: 1 
Popped Element: 1 
Stack is empty, you must PUSH an element before PEEKing one! 
Stack Top is: -1


However I was given a B due to the following reasons:


There was a better way of implementing it. 
I didn't manage well the case in which I'm trying to POP an element from an empty stack, since it's confusing that pop() returns a value even if Stack is empty.


Can you please help me understand how I could improve my code?

3750,Call a chain of WebRequest.BeginGetResponse in sync'ed fashion,"I am writing a Portable Class Library to be shared by desktop and WP8. In the library there is a method to get data from a website, in which method a chain of web requests have to be made in synchronized way and in certain order, result from each response feeds the next request, only the final response is interesting to user.

If this is a desktop .NET library, I would use GetResponse() and have all the logic in one method. I would invoke this whole method in a background thread to avoid blocking UI interaction. 

In PCL/WP8 there's only BeginGetResponse(), is there a design pattern or syntactic sugar I can leverage to write the synchronized call chain in a sequential way instead of having a bunch of callback methods?
",NS.X.,https://stackoverflow.com/users/986080,"HttpClient would be a better choice. If you can't use it for any reason, wrap BeginGetResponse/BeginGetResponse with Task.Factory.FromAsync, as an extension method:

static public Task&lt;WebResponse&gt; GetResponseAsTaskAsync(this WebRequest @this)
{
    return Task.Factory.FromAsync(
         (asyncCallback, state) =&gt;

         (asyncResult) =&gt;
             @this.EndGetResponse(asyncResult), null);
}


Then you do a blocking call like this:

var response = request.GetResponseAsTaskAsync().Result;


If you do a series of request, one after another, you should keep this logic asynchronous and let the client of your PCL library to decide whether to block or not. Something like this:

static public async Task&lt;WebResponse&gt; GetManyResponsesAsync(string[] urls)
{
    WebResponse lastResponse = null;
    foreach (url in urls)
    {
        var request = WebRequest.Create(url);
        var response = await request.GetResponseAsTaskAsync();
        // .. process response
        lastResponse = response;
    }
    return lastResponse;

The caller would have a choice to await on the result of GetManyResponsesAsync, or block with GetManyResponsesAsync().Result.

5244,Why is RSS distributed chi square times n-p?,"I would like to understand why, under the OLS model, the RSS (residual sum of squares) is distributed chi square times n-p (p being the number of parameters in the model, n the number of observations).

I apologize for asking such a basic question, but I seem to not be able to find the answer online (or in my, more application oriented, textbooks).
",Tal Galili,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/253,"I consider the following linear model: ${y} = X \beta + \epsilon$.

The vector of residuals is estimated by

$$\hat{\epsilon} = y - X \hat{\beta} 
                     = (I - X (X'X)^{-1} X') y
                     = Q y
                     = Q (X \beta + \epsilon) = Q \epsilon$$

where $Q = I - X (X'X)^{-1} X'$.

Observe that $\textrm{tr}(Q) = n - p$ (the trace is invariant under cyclic permutation) and that $Q'=Q=Q^2$. The eigenvalues of $Q$ are therefore $0$ and $1$ (some details below). Hence, there exists a unitary matrix $V$ such that (matrices are diagonalizable by unitary matrices if and only if they are normal.)

$$V'QV = \Delta = \textrm{diag}(\underbrace{1, \ldots, 1}_{n-p \textrm{ times}}, \underbrace{0, \ldots, 0}_{p \textrm{ times}})$$

Now, let $K = V' \hat{\epsilon}$.

Since $\hat{\epsilon} \sim N(0, \sigma^2 Q)$, we have $K \sim N(0, \sigma^2 \Delta)$ and therefore $K_{n-p+1}=\ldots=K_n=0$. Thus

$$\frac{\|K\|^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{\|K^{\star}\|^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2_{n-p}$$

with $K^{\star} = (K_1, \ldots, K_{n-p})'$.

Further, as $V$ is a unitary matrix, we also have

$$\|\hat{\epsilon}\|^2 = \|K\|^2=\|K^{\star}\|^2$$

Thus 

$$\frac{\textrm{RSS}}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2_{n-p}$$

Finally, observe that this result implies that 

$$E\left(\frac{\textrm{RSS}}{n-p}\right) = \sigma^2$$



Since $Q^2 - Q =0$, the minimal polynomial of $Q$ divides the polynomial $z^2 - z$. So, the eigenvalues of $Q$ are among $0$ and $1$. Since $\textrm{tr}(Q) = n-p$ is also the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their multiplicity, we necessarily have that $1$ is an eigenvalue with multiplicity $n-p$ and zero is an eigenvalue with multiplicity $p$.

6826,How to efficiently delete elements from vector c++,"I have a vector of pair of vectors(V1,V2) called pairV1V2 of the following form:

Here's a cleanup of your code for readability, I also ditched your end captures because ... you are deleting elements.

using vec_t = std::vector&lt;uint32_t&gt;;
using vecpair_t = std::pair&lt;vec_t, vec_t&gt;;

    pairvec_t pairV1V2;

        //Outer values
        auto&amp; outerV1 = itm-&gt;first; // NOTE '&amp;' - reference not copy!
        auto&amp; outerV2 = itm-&gt;second;
        sort(outerV2.begin(), outerV2.end());
        for(auto itm2 = itm + 1; itm2 != pairV1V2.end(); ++itm2)
        {
            auto&amp; innerV1 = itm2-&gt;first;
            auto&amp; innerV2 = itm2-&gt;second;
            vec_t setDiffV1;


As for another way to optimize this - since your lists are sorted - walk both lists at the same time comparing values.

template&lt;typename ValueType&gt;
void dedupe_vectors(
    typename std::vector&lt;ValueType&gt;&amp; lhs,
    typename std::vector&lt;ValueType&gt;&amp; rhs
    )
{
    auto lit = lhs.begin();
    auto rit = rhs.begin();
    while (rit != rhs.end) {
        while (lit != lhs.end() &amp;&amp; *lit &lt; *rit)
            ++lit;
        if (lit == lhs.end())
            break;
        if (*lit == *rit) {
            v2.erase(rit);
            continue;
        }  
        ++rit;
    }
}


I know - we test lit vs lhs.end twice. Take a look at the code your compiler generates with -O3 and see if it doesn't detect this itself. If so, then you can worry about optimizing it.

5774,Should I have one unified design between mobile and desktop?,"With a website I'm building, I'm wondering if I should combine the experiences between platforms together. For example, I'm wondering if I should keep this for both mobile and desktop. Here are some examples




I'm mainly wondering about the header. Is it bad to keep a more mobile like design (meaning slide menus, e.t.c.) on desktop, or should I utilize more of the space that mobile would not have?
",Tinfoilboy,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/47826,"First off all, I appreciate that you seem to design your responsive web with a mobile-first approach (that's how I perceive it anyway).

As Imperative has already stated, consistency is generally a good thing. However, the mobile-sized interface might still be come through as consistent with the desktop-sized ditto even though they don't share the exact same navigation pattern. For instance branding elements, graphical profile, copy, artwork and information architecture might keep it together just fine. Especially important is that the IA is, at least, very similar for the users to find their way around the site. When the content is grouped and structured the same way, a user that is familiar with one of the platforms but new to the second will know what to look for and have a hunch of how too, which helps a lot. 

The off-canvas drawer menu is (obviously) a solution that partially solves a common mobile interface problem: the deficit of real estate. But that's a problem that rarely applies when it comes to desktop interfaces. Consistency is valuable, but should you be consistent between your own interfaces, or with the standards for the respective platforms they're being used in?

Off-canvas drawer for mobile:  


Access to all top level navigation items in one place 
Robust in a sense that new items can be added in infinity (can be a curse too:)
Menu button is in a convenient position (even though it's usually in the ""hard"" corner)


Off-canvas for desktop: 


I guess Fitt's law still applies, and the expedition up the north-western corner of the screen can actually be quite long. A drop in efficiency?
You don't always want to fill the entire width with content as the user can use a very wide screen on a PC, which can make the positioning of the menu and its button really awkward, and actually even hard to see. 
A button in the corner can interfere with hot corners, or rather, the other way around. 
An extra click, that could have been avoided, is added to reach a menu item.
The menu items are obscured until the user has visited the menu, when they could have been displayed directly. 


Based on the arguments above, I would recommend a different pattern than the drawer menu for the desktop site.

Below is the schematic which I found in an article, slightly modified to suit the parts I have in hand --

Original had,

Q1 = BC548
Relay = 12V coil voltage


Mine has,

Q1 = BC547B
Relay = 5v coil voltage


Q1) Is that an acceptable conversion ? 

Note: The BC547B has Vcbo:50V, Vceo:45V, Vebo:6V, where-as the BC548 in original circuit has Vcbo:30V, Vceo:30V, Vebo:5V, rest of the parameters being pretty same as per datasheet (hFE:220-450).

The relay is the SPDT PCB-mount kind (rated for 10A @230VAC), also called ""sugar cube"".



Q2) The load I am trying to drive is resistive (60W 220VAC incandescent lamp). What changes might I need if I would like to drive loads like --


Fluorescent lamp
Fan (220VAC, 60W)
1HP Water pump (220VAC, 800W) -- One thought is to use higher current rated (e.g. 30A) relay. But, I think I need to worry about EM feedback which might cause arcing and destroy the EM relay.


Q3) Right now I am making this on a veroboard (el-cheapo phenolic kinds). While I understand that this may be sufficient for the lamp/fan control, I am wondering if I need something better for higher loads, s.a. the Water-pump control ? What is the minimum gauge wire to be used for this purpose ? What kind of connectors (terminal blocks) could be used ?

DO NOT USE  MAINS AC ON STRIP BOARD / VEROBOARD
that your days may be long on the face of the land. 


This is in fact doable with reasonable safety with proper care.
 BUT learning what ""proper"" means in this context is something best arrived at by some years of general experience. Destruction of equipment and / or life is easily achieved by applying AC mains to stuff and to people and it should not be dealt with lightly, ever.

Wire the mains wiring to the relay contacts  directly using appropriate connectors or hard soldering as appropriate.l If the relay is mounted on the veroboard, leave largish full holes in the veroboard around the contacts ad ALWAYS provide means of preventing user or other contact with live mains. 


Note that I said above  IF the relay is mounted on the veroboard,..."". 

I do not and did not recommend it.   

That was just for people who like to ignore good advice and to live dangerously. Better not to do it till you have lived longer and prospered somewhat. As you know, wax on wings tends to melt when flying too close to sunwards and mains shocks can be as lethal.    

If you MUST do this
(1) use high temperature wings when flying close to sun  - TEFLON may help.
(2) 8mm / 0.33 inch gaps all round MINIMUM between contact and anything else on board.
A GAP is a hole with air in it !!!!
Veroboard and similar  = Phenolic board = PAPER plus a resin.
Relying on paper board to not track, carbonise, absorb moisture or make deals with Murphy
is placing your life at risk.
Or somebody else's.  

Leaving an AIR gap is the equivalent to an 8mm creepage distance which is what most regulatory authorities prescribe in similar cases 

Leaving 8mm of Veroboard as an AC mains barrier is like tossing a coin 10 times and calling heads. You will probably get at least one head and would be surprised when you didn't.
The difference is, with a coin you have a silly look on your face when you fail, whereas with AC mains you may end up with a silly look on your dead face. 




(Q1)  Your driver is good EXCEPT 


The base drive resistor is far too low.  ee below.
they  have used a very non standard and confusing symbol for the output contacts. I assume this is a SPDT = sngle pole double throw (= single changeover ) contact with isolation between output circuit and 5V. 


The transistor may or may not be OK depending on coil current - see below.
 You do not specify the coil current, but say it is 200 mA.
 Icollector = Icoil = 200 mA
 Ibase >> to > Icollector/Beta = 200 mA / 200 = 1 mA 

I base = (Vdrive - Vbe) / Rbase or
 Rbase = (Vdrive - Vbe ) / Ibase.

For Vdrive = 5V,
 Rbase = (5-0.7) / 0.001 = 4300 ohms.

A resistor that gives substantially more than 1 mA is desirable 9allows beta to be low etc). So R1 = 1k = 1000 ohms would be fine.

Even with say 3V drive.
 Ib = (Vdrive - Vbe)/R1 = (3-0.7)/1000 = 2.3 mA.
 With a Beta of 200 Icmax = beta x Ib = 200 x 2.3 = 460 mA.
 If relay current &lt; 200 mA then 1K is stioll good.
 If relay current is higher the value of R1 MAY need adjusting - probably not.



(Q2) Your basic circuit is good for load power at any sensible level, subject to suitable coil drive power AND possibly some sort of snubbing of the contacts.

The relay or contactor has to have contacts rated for the load carried - which will be in the relevant datasheet. 

A ""snubber"" is a circuit designed to absorb transient AC energy which may othewise cause contact arcing when the contacts open. It usually consists of a series C and R such that the C limits the current to a low value in the R under normal conditions but when high voltage and/or high frequency transients occur the R current and dissipation increase and absorb the transient energy.

There have been various other stack exchange questions re snubbers eg
 here &amp; here &amp; here &amp; here
 and there is lots of on-web resources eg
 Wikipedia
 Good intro
 Good. Slightly more complex  

Good - with online calculator



Non dissipative version (from above link)



and manufacturer of relays etc will often specify what is needed for their product with a given load. 



[Q3} Wire size. Terminal block size.

Too general for easy answer.
 Many wire tables are available re current/gauge.
 ""As thick as you can sensibly handle with no great effort"" is usually enough.
 Occasionally you need thick enough to be hard or annoying, but that is usually at low voltage, not at mains voltages.



Transistor selection:

The BC547b is rated at only 100 mA Ic. Datasheet here
 This may be OK BUT a much better transistor is available which is often as cheap and sometimes cheaper.
 This is the BC337 (NPN). BC327 (PNP). Also availabl in SOT23 SMD as BC817/BC807.  I use these as my standard ""jellybean"" transistors. They will meet almost any need that you'd sensibly use them for, and in most cases a better transistor is not available without paying a lot more. 

These are available in several beta ranges. I always buy the highest beta bin range = BC337-40 which has beta in the range 250 - 600 with mean of 400.
 BC337-40 etc 800 mA*, 50V.

Creepage / Mains clearance

Phenolic PCB has its specialist uses but really really should be avoided for most purposes. The savings in cost are not vast compared to eg FR4 fibreglass. Phenolics main advantages are cost (minor gain) and ""punchability"". It is amenable to having holes or slots etc cut by punching tather than drilling or routing. In general use it is a nasty PCB material. It break and shatters. It risks breakdown. It is not fire or moisture proof. Caveat emptor!

Excellent creepage &amp; clearance page here

Excellent TI power supply safety design paper here  - Image from this  shown below. 



Excellent creepage &amp; celarance page here.

Note they say: 


When designing a switch-mode power supply for use in information technology (IT) equipment, a typical rule of thumb is to allow an 8-mm creepage distance between primary and secondary circuits, and a 4-mm distance between primary and ground. If these dimensions are allowed for during the design stage, there is a high probability (95%) that no failure will occur with respect to creepage or clearance when the final product is submitted for test.


All the above are liable to lead you to conclude that my advice was too conservative and that you can use lower limits with Vero board. It wasn't. You can't with any safety.

If I do this, it kills the app before showing the ad:

  RevMob revmob = RevMob.start(this); 
  revmob.showFullscreen(this);
  android.os.Process.killProcess(android.os.Process.myPid());

So it thought about waiting 10seconds before killing the app, but I don't know how to do it correctly. I tried a lot of things, like this:

    onBackPressedExit();

What are my options? Will any hardware supported by gpsd work with the Pi?
",Maria Zverina,https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/188,"GPS Receiver

I would go for a generic usb GPS receiver such as the BU-353



It works with the Raspberry Pi, just like a normal linux computer. 

Most usb GPS receivers are just USB-to-Serial adapters that read the NMEA data from the GPS receiver. Look into pl2303 (many units i've seen use this particular chip) drivers, should be available. 

You can also use GPIO and a traditional NMEA 0183 GPS receiver, but then you need to worry about power, and the prices are often higher. GPS antannas are common onboard boats and ships, and usually consume 12v.

The usb solution is cheaper.

Software

The gps receiver I mentioned is compatible with gpsd.

sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps


This will install gpsd and related software. Check gps status with cgps -s.

NTP Clock

To synchronize the clock with NTP, you need to install ntp.

sudo apt-get install ntp


See this blog post: http://blog.retep.org/2012/06/18/getting-gps-to-work-on-a-raspberry-pi/. It covers ntp in detail.

",JCab,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/3639,"Simply put Evangelicals differ over at least three primary things:

1. The Nature of Jesus

Evangelicals believe Jesus to be God - of one being with Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, etc... Mormons do not. Mormons believe Jesus to be divine, but a separate person from the Father. Evangelicals tend to subscribe to the historic creeds of the church - Nicene, Apostles, etc... - and are almost invariably Trinitarian.  (I cannot say that I have ever run across a non-Trinitarian Evangelical, but as it is a movement and not a denomination, there are always exceptions).

Note: In the comments, there was a notion that the creeds only adhered to the ""Catholic"" church.  Insofar as ""catholic"" is understood as ""universal"" or ""what most people think of when they think of 'mainstream' Christianity, that is accurate.  If that were taken to mean the 'Roman Catholic Church,' that would be precise, but inaccurate, in that most Protestants and Orthodox also subscribe to the Creeds and to the Trinitarian formulations thereof.

2. The nature of the ""Bible""

Evangelicals consider the canon to be closed. Mormons have their own scriptures composed well after the period.

3. The nature of soteriology

Evangelicals, by and large, believe salvation to be solely the gift of God. We believe that all who are saved entire into eternal relationship with God. Mormons believe that people are rewarded according to the nature of the covenant they believed.

I have a form that pops up, and on submitting (or clicking a link) in the form, this might open another ""colorbox"" modal. It works smoothly, but there's one thing that bothers me.

As it is, colorbox seems to wait until it receives the response (via ajax) and then shows a ""loading.gif"" and starts to change size.

To me it makes more sense to have the ""loading.gif"" show as soon as they are opening a new colorbox modal. (and not just the image, I just mean that whatever happens when you open a new colorbox) It doesn't have to resize (obviously) but it's just annoying because some of my colorbox modals use webservices that are slow, so you might submit a form and nothing happens for literally 1 or 2 seconds. It'd be nice if it just would look like it was loading the next one for that time.

1536,How to configure ssh tunneling with Putty between two RHEL servers?,"I'm trying to allow ssh access from a remote RHEL server to a local RHEL box via Win/Putty gateway. Basically, I'd like to be able to do 'ssh localhost -p 512' on a remote server so that it would connect to the RHEL server in the local network. The local network is beyond a firewall so I can connect from my Win PC to the remote server with Putty/ssh but not vice verse.

LclSrv----WinXP/Putty-----||-----RmtSrv

So, I've added the following tunneling settings to the current RmtSrv session in Putty (actually I use Kitty but doesn't matter):

R512 LclSrv:22

I expect that this would create a process on the remote server that listens port 512 and transfers the connections to a local network/LclSrv port 22.

After pressing start button, Putty opens a regular ssh terminal session successfully but nothing happens. (options show active port forwarding). I've checked with netstat -l that port 512 is not listening on RmtSrv. ssh on this port returns 'connection refused'. What am I doing wrong? May be there is something in the sshd_config that needs to be changed in order to allow the tunneling? Could it be user privileges on RmtSrv that prevents me from creating tunnels? I have sudo btw.

First of all, you need to handle your own primary key generation, because when inserting records on different sites, primary keys can/will be the same. Unique primary key generation is not easy to accomplish. 

Furthermore, you need some conflict resolution. Updates or Deletes made on either side have to be reflected to the other site. Often, you cannot solve conflicts without user intervention.  

My advise: look at built-in (two-way) replication, native to the database. It will save you a lot of headache.

8527,"What do you call a customer's customer in a specification document, use case, or scenario?","My team and I develop software that our customers will use to interact with their customers.  Additionally, we also eat our own dogfood and use the software ourselves to interact with our customers.

Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to explain use cases and scenarios, as our employees can be operators, our customers can be operators, and our customers' customers can be visitors.

However, our customers can also be visitors interacting with our operator employees, our customers' customers can be visitors interacting with our customer or our employee.

Here is a model where:

A is an employee
B is a customer
C is our customers' customer

X  interacts with  Y
Operator --&gt; Visitor
      A  --&gt;  B
      A  --&gt;  C
      B  --&gt;  C


Because sometimes our customers can play different roles, it's sometimes necessary to refer to the specific role, Operator or Visitor, instead of Employee and Customer.

It's also a mouthful to say ""customer's customer"" all the time.

I was wondering how other development shops handle these semantic details when writing their use cases and scenarios.  


Are there any one-word, generic terms that can apply to any product that involves a third-level actor?
Other than using the specific roles, Operator and Visitor, what words could be used to identify a customer of a customer?  


The word would need to be short enough as to be adopted within an organization.  If longer than a couple syllables, it's shortened form must still differentiate it from the other actors.

So, what does this mean? The terminator cannot destroy himself unless it is absolutely necessary in order to succeed in his mission (like protect John?)?

In that case, what was the Terminator in part 1 going to do after the success of his mission (i.e. destroy Sarah)? Just live a long happy life and wait for Skynet arise?

Update:
I understand that this is not the exact Third law of Asimov, since the terminators definitely don't follow the First or Second law. Let's call it the law of self-preservation. Does terminator have a form of self-preservation to some point and the prohibition of suicide?

There is an instance in the latest movie where one of the machines terminated itself. This was when they were testing the magic signal. While it wasn't a ""terminator"" it came from the same place and therefore had the same programming. The difference with Arine is that he was reprogrammed by the Humans and therefore could have had the three laws apply.

5991,What's the best way to scan in hundreds of pictures?,"I have thousands of old pictures which were sitting in a photo album. Unfortunately, instead of the photo album protecting the pictures, the plastic coverings yellowed, and the pictures themselves had to be carefully extracted from the books. There is also quite a bit of powdered paper (the backings on the books pretty much fell apart while we extracted the pictures), and the fronts of the images are still a bit sticky.

",Furious,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/22612,"Assuming plain (American) white rice on a stovetop:

(Generally, American rice does not need rinsing for these applications)

From your description, it sounds like you are going for Steamed Rice; for that, here's what you want to do:

Bring your water, salt and butter to a boil, then add your rice. Stir it until it comes back to a boil. As soon as it boils again, turn your heat way down. Keep stirring until the heat is low enough that you feel safe that you can cover the pot without it hard boiling again. Cover and keep on low to medium-low heat or a moderate simmer (preferably without peeking) for 20 minutes (15 minimum). It is the steam that plumps the rice, so don't lift the lid! It may take some tweaking depending upon your specific equipment, but try to be patient. You may find that you like a little less water and a bit more time. When you do peek (hopefully after at least 15-20 minutes have passed) look for the water to be gone and for little holes or ""divots"" to be formed on the surface of the rice. If you still have water, cover again and keep cooking without lifting the lid for at least 5 more minutes. When it looks done, turn off the heat but still don't stir, you're better off just letting it sit for another 5 minutes - re-covered and with the heat turned off, then stir/fluff it.

If you find that your rice isn't done after 20-25 minutes with the lid on, bring up the heat a bit, but be careful. If your heat is too high, your rice can burn on the bottom. Within reason, if it's just a bit too low, it'll just take longer.

The lid is really key here. Do you have a tight lid for the pan that you are using? If not, we can help you improvise.

A slightly different method using the same ingredients is the Pilaf Method shown here in a great video from the love of my life, Alton Brown. 20 Minute Pilaf See the rice just before he fluffs it with chopsticks? Those are the holes/divots I referred to above in the explanation of the steaming method. In case the link goes bad, here's a description of the video: Bring 3 cups of water to a rolling boil. Meanwhile, in a saucepan with a tight lid, melt and lightly brown 2 Tbs of butter over high heat. Add 2 cups of rice (regular long grain, basmati or jasmine recommended) and saute for a couple of minutes, add 1 tsp salt (Alton uses kosher). When the rice smells ""nutty"" add the boiling water all at once (careful, it will boil rather violently). Cover and turn heat to low. No peeking, cook on low for 15 minutes. Fluff with chopsticks or a fork. Cover again for 5 minutes, no heat.

Note that Alton's pilaf also requires a tight fitting lid. If your lid isn't tight, try using aluminum foil to get a tighter seal.

Finally: With very small variations, these two methods of cooking rice will work fine for just about any type of rice. Some rice, particularly some rice harvested outside of the US should be thoroughly rinsed first. Check your label if you can or revisit this question if you're not sure if your rice should be rinsed. If you use rinsed rice you may find that you want to use slightly less water for cooking than instructed here.

You're using a 2 to 1 ratio for steaming rice, that's fairly typical but you might like a bit less water, just don't go lower than 1.5 to 1. 

Brown rice works fine for these methods too but will take longer and require slightly more water.

The steaming method, particularly if you wait to ""fluff"" will produce a stickier rice, better for chopsticks :) and better to accompany food that has a sauce you want the rice to soak up. I prefer steamed rice to go with stir-fries, for example.

The pilaf method, particularly with medium to long grained rice will produce more individual grains. Nice with steak or baked chicken, something that isn't sauced.

If you are using a grounded plug and feel ground loop current you should either have the outlet serviced or the computer serviced.

It's normal (and safe) for ground loop current to exist and feel lightly tingly on Macs with magsafe connectors and only DC power going in to them. It's harder to be sure an iMac or other device that has 110/220 AC power directly into the case, so I would rather be too cautious and have you get an electrician to look at the outlet if your Mac works properly on other outlets or a technician to look at the Mac if it leaks current no matter which receptacle you plug it in to.

You might be able to find a grounding issue and solve this yourself, but if you have any doubts as to safety, I'd rather you chose to get expert help rather than trust our guesses based on how things should work.

What do you do that day in shul?

",Monica Cellio,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/472,"As for women 'bentsching gomel', Dose of Halacha writes:


  ..The minhag is to recite it within 3 days of the incident after krias hatorah, though it may be recited later if necessary (Shulchan Aruch OC 219:6; Mishna Berura 20).
  
  The Chayei Adam (after 69) wrote a prayer after surviving an explosion. He writes that one should say this, along with the pesukim of the korban toda and give charity equal to the value of the animal he would have brought in Temple times. (See Mishna Berura 218:31).
  
  While women would also bring korbanei todah, the custom developed among many Ashkenazi communities that women don’t say the beracha, as the public recital is deemed immodest. The Magen Avraham (OC 219:4) writes that her husband should recite it on her behalf, while the Mishna Berura says that she recites it in front of ten women and a man. The Aruch Hashulchan (OC 219:6) suggests that this custom may have developed because women weren’t always present for Leining. Nonetheless, the Baer Hetev (219:1), Chayei Adam (65:6), Yechave Daas (4:15) and others all allow a woman to say it loudly from her side of the mechitza. Thus, Sefardi women should only say it in the presence of a minyan.
  
  In what is likely the last teshuva R’ Moshe Feinstein ever wrote (OC 5:14), he paskens that a new mother should recite the beracha in front of another, ideally her husband, and there is no need for a minyan.
  
  In England, we generally follow the Minchas Yitzchak (4:11). Women go to Shul and respond to their husband’s borchu and beracha (when he’s called up), with intent to thank Hashem.

As side note, remember that the system will never compare two files in order to know if they are identical and then skip the copy.
If you want to accomplish this behavior, then you have to implement it by yourself, but it would usually be heavier than simply overwriting, due to the need to fully read the destination file, unless you implement some caching mechanism or the destination file is already (and still) in system cache.

We are using Visual Studio 2013 and NuGet 2.8.5.

EDIT:

Using Fiddler, I have confirmed that NuGet is indeed searching for the packages in the incorrect source.  It is requesting the following packages from my private repository.

I also read this post and added the activePackageSource section to the NuGet.config file:

My life-goal is being a professor. And I love to do research. 

PhD is surely a bite that not everyone can chew.
But I wonder who can chew it?

I never was good at tests and exams. My BSc. GPA was 2.84/4.00 but finished my MSc. with 3.50/4.00

However, currently I am working on a conference paper and I feel like even that is too much for me. It has been nearly 3 months and still, the paper draft is to be improved (not the wording but the content).

I am surely a hard-worker but not always. Sometimes, I let go of my work and absorbed in other stuff (composing, amateur radio etc). If this period is too wide, I have to spend double effort to warm-up and remember where I left.

I don't know how things work in PhD. It usually is 5-6 years. It is the one of two most-challenging milestones in academic career (the other is getting the title Assoc. Prof).
Should I completely be a ""nerd"" and work on my thesis systematically (something I could never make in my entire life) or working periodically but with extra effort is still sufficient?

So, here's my question: If I say ""I'm considering to do PhD"" and ask your advice, what would you ask me? What kind of skills/characteristics do you look for a potential academician?

I know it is way too late for me to ask this kind of question, as a person who almost finished his master's degree. But better lose the saddle than the horse.

This is the number one reason to get into grad school. However, it's not clear at this point that you have an accurate idea of what it means, on a daily basis, to work in research.

Sure there are fun times fiddling with the knobs of expensive equipment, drawing equations on napkins until late in the night, traveling to exotic conference locations like Baltimore, etc. There are also these brief moments when you feel like an undergrad actually learned something from you, and those where you share inside jokes that you can tell for sure only your advisor and yourself can understand. I recall a quote from a senior researcher in my field saying ""Can you believe that they pay us to do what we love?"".

But there are other aspects that are less glamorous. Administrative work, data bookkeeping, actual bookkeeping, wondering what you will do with your life, filing grant applications, etc. There is the anguish about funding, the frustration of aborted projects, the time and energy wasted in dealing with department politics.

And there is teaching which can be both a joy and a pain in the neck.


  My BSc. GPA was 2.84/4.00 but finished my MSc. with 3.50/4.00


I don't know what GPA is, nor how to interpret your grade, but the context tells me that you think they could be better. Passing exams and conducting research are different jobs, not being excellent at one does not mean you can't be good at the second one (a) although it often helps; b) the reverse is also true). It will make things harder for you when applying to grad school, but after that it becomes irrelevant. What matters more is what you actually learned, some people have ok grades but understood a great deal of the concepts.


  I let go of my work and absorbed in other stuff


That you will have to work on. There is an infinite number of things that you can do but work on your research. Nobody will force you to do it since pretty much the only one who will suffer from your procrastination will be you. The good news (sort of) is that you are not alone...


  What kind of skills/characteristics do you look for a potential
  academician?


There are many, and most of them overlap with what it needs to achieve a successful career in the industry. But I don't know any successful researcher who is not thorough. Being creative sure is necessary, but it's the easiest part. What will make you stand out is when you can discipline yourself into rigorously testing them.

It also help if you know how to sell your ideas. Researchers hate to admit it but a significant factor in their success relates to how well they can convey a message. (Note that bad communication is an indicator of bad science, but it gives a lot of false positive).

How should I store leftover cooked rice noodles to best preserve them for a day or two?

UPDATE: I tried storing them in cold water, and that's definitely not the way to go; the rice noodles bloated to about double their original thickness.  They taste fine, just not what I was looking to accomplish.
",Jeff Axelrod,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/2690,"From the point of view of someone who used to work in a Chinese restaurant, we used to prepare vermicelli which are really thin rice noodles by soaking the uncooked dry noodles in cold water for about 1 hour or until it is flexible. We then can store this soaked, but uncooked noodle covered with a plastic wrap in the refrigerator for several days. They don't need to be oiled. To cook it, we just submerge it in boiling water for about a minute and then prepare it however we need it. With the soak it takes practically no time to cook at all.

Perhaps in the future you can follow this method and pre-soak your noodles. Then you can use however much noodles you need from that batch and save the rest for later. Plus it'll save on cooking time.

We have a tank alarm in this tank with the pump, but someone (not sure if it was me or someone else) forgot to turn back on the alarm one time. So now that 1000 gallon tank is over flowing. The pump circuit has been blowing for me at the fuse box. It seems to blow the circuit based on getting a bunch of rain. I'll do a separate question for that.

My question is this. I can hear the pump run for a bit (I haven't kept track of the time) then stop. After a while it will start again. Is there a safety or something that would cause the pump to not run until there is no water left? This happens no matter if the float is hooked up or I am just plugged in straight. Or could it be the drainage field is full of water and needs to seep out so there is room for more?

I know the tank isn't empty cause shortly after the pump stops, water starts seeping out of the lid again. (and the alarm light is still on).

6341,"Why Do People ""Pre-empt"" With Seven Of A Suit In Bridge?","One advantage of a ""pre-empt"" is quite clear: You take two levels of bidding away from your opponents with a ""three"" bid. But could that be cutting off your nose to spite your face?

Recently, I had something like KQxxxxx, and a side queen (I forget how the other suits were distributed but was told it didn't matter). My partner was disappointed I didn't ""preempt"" (in ""third"" seat). My response was ""with seven points?""

My understanding is that people often bid three of a suit with seven cards and this little. Sometimes even less, particularly when non-vulnerable vs. vulnerable. In its extreme version, the mantra is ""with any seven (suited) cards.""

Isn't this risky? What if we're doubled and only make three or four tricks?
",Tom Au,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/1344,"Originally (when Culbertson and others first studied Contract Bridge), the rule was ""Seven cards and an outside Ace"". With that and even a semi-reasonable dummy, you can usually make your contract, if left in it.

But a little more study revealed that the hands you don't make are usually the ones where the opponents have an easy game/slam and, more importantly, starting at the three-level often makes it impossible for them to find the right contract, even if they do bid. Too valuable to restrict: cutting the outside Ace down to a King or Queen reduces the chance of making your contract, but offers much greater scope to interfere with the opponents, so reducing their score at the risk of a small penalty to you.

I could immediately tell that the music was live, being played in the bar at that moment. This is something I have often noticed, I can tell whether music is recorded or being played live. 

This seems to extend to recordings of live music as well. I have often found myself identifying that the musical background of, for example, a youtube video was being played at the time and was recorded using the same microphone that recorded the ambient sound of the video.

First of all, I assume that I am not alone and that any musician or music lover can also make this distinction. So, why can we do this? What is it that allows us to recognize live performances? I assume it has something to do with the way they are recorded (or not as the case may be) and that a good sound engineer would be able to fix things so that I couldn't tell but what does it depend on?
",terdon,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/9576,"Recorded music has the acoustics of two rooms.  Strongly amplified live music actually tends to have a lot more problems than studio music because you have the mics also picking up the PA and the environment and the sound intended for other mics.  Of course, that does not hold for electric guitars and other instruments amplified without microphones.

Unplugged music is rather direct and clear.  Recorded music only picks up the sound at a number of defined points and gets mixed to two channels usually.  A lot of spatial information gets lost in that way.

That's one reason that Hammond organs have been semi-popular: the rotating Leslie speakers used with them create a great spacy sound in concert, but the effect is practically not recordable in a manner reproducing its character well.  Neither for replay of recordings, nor for remitting over a big powerful PA.

Being in accordance with, conforming to, or upholding the exact or primary meaning of a word or words.
Word for word; verbatim: a literal translation.
Avoiding exaggeration, metaphor, or embellishment; factual; prosaic: a literal description; a literal mind.


So what does it mean then to ‘take the Bible literally?’ Which definition are we referring to when we say ‘I take the Bible literally?’
",Mike,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/1743,"A literal interpretation is often in contrast to a symbolic or metaphoric interpretation.  A literal interpretation accepts the text as written to be historical and factual, while a metaphorical interpretation will often reject the historicity of a particular account and accept the moral or principle of the account.

This does not mean that literal interpretations force everything to be historical, like the parables of Jesus, but it accepts narrative as historical, poetry as poetry, and prophecy as prophecy.

When the Bible says God created Adam on the sixth day, a literal interpretation accepts that as historical and factual, while a metaphoric interpretation would likely see the whole creation account as unhistorical.

You could use some form of strapping on the back side.



With this option, you can extend the strapping and use it to attach the whole bit to the workbench.



Bored Holes

You could bore holes on the edge of the top or bottom piece to about half the width of the board, then use screws to fasten the two boards together.



You'll likely want to use a drill press to bore the holes.

Glue

Since it's not going to be structural, you could simply glue the two boards together using wood glue.

If you want to get real fancy, a sliding dovetail would work.

354,Prospects with a Computational Social Science degree,"During college, I decided to use my free electives to pursue a second major I had an interest in (Sociology) besides my main focus on computer science. 

I am contemplating applying to some phD programs that intersect both of these fields. However, I know these are new programs.

I have e-mailed a few departments but I get the vibe that they are more focused in getting people to apply to these new programs rather than necessarily being honest about prospects. 

So my question is essentially, are there tenure track professorships that are interested in applicants with these kinds of backgrounds? And if so is it only a very small group of institutions?

",Bob,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/8410,"I'm in the CSS department at George Mason University, just starting my dissertation.  Though I'm not primarily aimed at tenure-track academic jobs after graduating, I have some insights regarding the questions you have asked.

First, you should know that CSS at GMU (and most other places similar to it) are not solely focused on placing their graduates into academic jobs.  There's a wide diversity of career paths, both prior to entering and after graduating.  To me, that creates a looseness and openness among the students.  This is in contrast to discipline-focused departments where everyone is expected to prepare for and compete for top academic jobs.  In those situations, there seems to be a strong emphasis on things other than just learning and doing good research (competition, prizes/awards, getting into the 'in crowd', elitism, etc.)

Second, CSS would be a poor fit for many academic jobs (research or teaching) that really want depth and credentials in a single discipline -- Economics, Sociology, Business, or Computer Science.

Finally, there is significant growth in the number of departments and jobs (internationally and in the US) that specifically call for Computational Social Science or similar interdisciplinary degree.  This is driven in part by funding agencies who have become very enthusiastic for CSS and similar types of programs and projects.  It's also driven by market demand -- especially for social network analysis, Big Data in social science, and programmatic research (e.g. public health, international development, conflict studies, cyber security). While the number of these jobs may not be large in absolute terms,  CSS graduates could be extremely well-qualified to fill them, compared to single-discipline graduates.

",Rory,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/48536,"Ok, I'm probably going to get a ton of down-votes for this, but programming and maths are two completely unrelated things. Someone can be an amazing developer knowing only the basics like addition, multiplication and basic logical operations.

Most of the developers will not solve a single equation during their professional career, and things like big O notation can be grasped in non mathematical way as well. You just think about the stuff, imagine bits flipped in your head, and voila, you can tell what kind of big O the stuff is, if someone explains what log and power is.

Sometimes math can make it simple, or it can make you feel proud that you proved something, since you can extend the meaning of programming to a mathematical domain via naming it discrete maths and such, but learning a lot of differential equations and integrals, and how to prove that, is IMHO not exactly the best idea what to do if you want to succeed as a programmer.

At least I haven't touched the maths for 10 years, I had arguments with my math professors all the time, and when I needed a math for realtime rendering, I learned everything from programmers side of view, without any proving any theorems, and for me it was simple and easy to grasp compared to all the stuff math professors where putting in our heads with a comment of ""you can't be a good programmer if you don't know the math"". Sure you can, easy!

I now know the mathematical stuff, so that I can talk with math-background programmers with all the log's differentials and stuff, but only for the reason so that they wouldn't faint. Because that stuff is useless 99.9% of the time, and when it is, it can be learned 1000x more effectively from programmers viewpoint.

Heck, programmers need at least 5 years to master a programming language+frameworks+best practices. Why on earth they should learn how to prove the theorems? Math student's do the math stuff, programmers get that stuff running, that's how it should work.

PhD admissions committees at strong departments are looking for clear evidence of potential for high-quality independent research.

Test scores only matter if they're low.  In particular, if your math score is low, there will be serious doubts about your math ability, and if your verbal/TOEFL score is low, there will be serious questions about your communication skills.  In some departments (like mine in CS), admission to the PhD requires a TOEFL Speak score above a certain minimum (in my case: 22), because all PhD students are expected to be TAs at least once while they're in the program, and the state of Illinois requires a minimum Speak score (in my case: 24) on TAs who are not native English speakers.

Publication records only matter if the papers are either good or horrible.  It's utterly impossible to tell from the number of publications whether the applicant has significant promise for future independent research.  High-quality papers, written in flawless English, published in well-known venues that are easily accessible online from the US, are definitely helpful.

A)  The hydraulics for the convertible top are low (to the point where the top won't even start to open anymore),

B)  The trunk latch is disconnected internally, so the trunk can't be opened.

If the top were still working, it can be opened partway to access the back of the trunk latch, and operate it manually...  or if the trunk would open, I'd have access to the manual release for the top.  But the combination of these two means I have no way to open either now.

So:  Are there any other tricks I can use in this situation?

One possible idea:  If I tear out the headliner (which I'd probably have to cut away, since the screws are only accessible with the top out), and disconnect the lines coming from the hydraulic pump, would this allow the top to move by hand?  This seems plausible, but I don't want to destroy my headliner on a hunch...

9333,Questions about geometric distribution,"I have some trouble understanding the record value for a sequence of i.i.d. random variables of geometric distribution. Following quotation is from Univariate discrete distributions By Norman Lloyd Johnson, Adrienne W. Kemp, Samuel Kotz.


  The lack-of-memory property of the
  geometric distribution gives it a role
  comparable to that of the exponential
  distribution. There are a number of
  characterizations of the geometric
  distribution based on record values.



For the  record time $T_n$, 


  If $X_j$ is observed at time $j$ ,
  then the record time sequence $\{T_n ,n \geq 0\}$ is defined as
  $T_0 = 1$
  with probability $1$ and $T_n = \min\{j : X_j &gt; X_{t_{n−1}} \}$ for
  $n\geq 1$. 


Is there a typo in $T_n = \min \{j : X_j &gt;
    X_{t_{n−1}} \}$? Should it be instead $T_n
    = \min\{j : X_j &gt; X_{T_{n−1}} \}$?
For the  record value $R_n$, 


  The record value sequence
  $\{R_n \}$ is defined as $R_n =X_{T_n} , n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. Suppose
  that the $X_j$ ’s are iid geometric
  variables with pmf $$p_x = p(1 − p)^{x−1}, x = 1, 2, ...$$ Then $R_n
    =X_{T_n} = \sum_{j=0}^{n} X_j$ is
  distributed as the sum of $n + 1$ iid
  geometric variables.


why does the second equality in
""$R_n =X_{T_n} = \sum_{j=0}^{n} X_j$
"" hold?
For the process of the record values
$\{ R_n, n \in \mathbb{N}\}$, 


  Each of the following properties
  characterizes the geometric
  distribution: 
  
  (i) Independence: The rv’s $R_0 , R_1  - R_0 , ... , R_{n+1} - R_n ,...$ are independent. 
  
  (ii) Same Distribution: $R_{n+1} - R_n$ has the same distribution as
  $R_0$ . 
  
  (iii) Constant Regression: $E[R_{n+1}- R_n |R_n ]$ is constant.


How to show that the three
properties hold? Are they derived
from the memoryless property of
geometric distribution?

What else can we say about the
process based on the memoryless
property of geometric distribution?


Thanks for your advice!
",Ethan,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/3616,"Your second point looks wrong in the book.  I think
$$R_n = X_{T_n} = X_{T_0} + \sum_{i=1}^n \left(X_{T_i} - X_{T_{i-1}}\right)$$ 
or 
$$R_n = X_{T_n} = R_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n (R_i - R_{i-1})$$
might be better (and obvious).  

Since $T_0 = 1$, $R_0 = X_{T_0} = X_1$, identically distributed as each of the $X_j$. 

This is where the memorylessness of the geometric distribution applies, because it has the property that $R_n - R_{n-1} = X_{T_n} - X_{T_{n-1}}$ has the same distribution as $X_j$ because if $X_{T_{n-1}} = k$ then
$$Pr(X_{T_n} - X_{T_{n-1}} = m) = Pr(X_{T_n} = m+k | X_{T_n} &gt; k) = \frac{p(1 − p)^{m+k−1}}{\sum_{j \ge 1} p(1 − p)^{j+k−1} } = p(1 − p)^{m−1}$$
and is independent of k and of all the $X_j$ for $j &lt; T_{n-1}$ and $j&gt;T_n$

So $R_j - R_{j-1}$ has the same distribution as $X_j$ and combined with independence leads to $R_n$ having the same distribution as $\sum_{j=0}^n X_j$, i.e. 


  as the sum of $n + 1$ iid geometric variables.


as the book says.

I think the book is wrong with its equals sign: two (sums of) random variables can have the same distribution without being the same.  If $A$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$ and $B = 1-A$, then $A$ and $B$ have the same distribution, but they are unlikely to be equal to each other.

Obviously systems on the microscopic level are fully determined by the microscopic equations of motion. So if you want to introduce a law on top of that, you have to prove consistency, i.e. entropy cannot be a postulate.
I can imagine that it is derived from probability theory for general system. Do you know such a line?

Once you have such a reasoning, what are the assumptions to it?
Can these assumptions be invalid for special systems? Would these system not obey thermodynamics, statistical mechanics and not have any sort of temperature no matter how general?

4498,Need help with a subsets problem,"With the set $X=\{1,2,...,n\}$, How many subsets of $X$ contain $1$? How many subsets of $X$ don't contain $1$?

My work: 
I know a set with $n$ elements has $2^n$ subsets. The way I tackled this problem was to make a finite set like {1,2,3} and tried to make some generalization from it. I made a decision tree diagram to figure out the different subsets. 

If $1$ was contained in the subset, then the different subsets with $1$ would be:
$$\{1,2,3\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1\} $$ 
which made me think there are four subsets. $2^n = 4$ which means $n=2$ but there are 3 elements in here so I generalized it as:
$$2^{n-1}$$
where $n \ge 1$ such that $n \in N $ is how many subsets of X that contain $1$.

And for the subsets of $X$ that don't contain $1$, the answer should come out the same as the previous question because, again, if I were to make a finite set like $\{1,2,3\}$, then the subsets without $1$ would be:
$$\{2,3\}, \{2\}, \{3\},  \{\emptyset\}  $$

which is also, $$2^{n-1}$$
where $n \ge 1$ such that $n \in N $ is how many subsets of X that don't contain $1$.

I think it makes sense in my head but I am still unsure. Am I understanding this problem correctly or am I completely missing it? 
",Jeff Thykes,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/92014,"You've found the correct result; you just have to prove it. HINT: There's a bijection between the sets that contain $1$ and the sets that don't: if $1\in A$, pair $A$ with $A\setminus\{1\}$. Alternatively, each set that does not contain $1$ is a subset of the $(n-1)$-element set $\{2,\ldots,n\}$, and you know how many subsets that has.

4860,Why does SnCl2 occur despite the octet rule?,"Shouldn't reaching an octet be any atom's ""goal""?

However, I've recently learned about cases that are either expanding octets, or have lesser than ""enough"" electrons for an octet abiding. e.g.:

S in Sulfur hexafluoride (Expanding octet with a $\text{3d}$)



Source

B in Boron trifluoride (It's ""hexet"", instead of octet)



Source

However, both $\ce{SnCl2}$ and $\ce{SnCl4}$ are existent. The latter is explainable with octet, but not the former. Surprisingly, $\ce{SnCl2}$ is more stable! 


How?
Why is the phenomenon happening?




Dave pointed out that the octet nonabidingness is happening in the vapor phase. So I redirect the question to ask about the vapor phase; since that's what I'm looking for.
",M.A.R.,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/7448,"There is another rather more simple answer to the question:

$\ce{SnCl2}$ can be thought of as a salt to a much greater extent than $\ce{SnCl4}$. In fact, tin is so often thought of as a metal, that it takes some people time to understandt that $\ce{SnCl4}$ is in fact not a salt but much more a molecule.

Then, when looking at $\ce{Sn(II)}$, it becomes clear that the unaccompanied ion would have the electron configuration $\ce{[Kr] 4d^{10} 5s^2}$ — doesn’t that look stable to you? Add to chloride ions that took the electrons originally having been in the $\ce{5p}$-orbitals and voilà.



I know that this answer simplifies a lot of things that maybe shouldn’t be simplified in all cases. But to the best of my knowledge it explains the compound and its stability well, and should therefore be considered. Once the question turns into ‘why is $\ce{Sn(II)}$ ionic, while $\ce{Sn(IV)}$ better described as molecular?’, if of course becomes invalid.

3851,What is temptation?,"Temptation, in the common secular sense, seems to indicate an attraction to something.


  Temptation
  
  
  The act of tempting
  The condition of being tempted.
  Something attractive, tempting or seductive; an inducement or enticement.
  Pressure applied to your thinking designed to create wrong emotions which will eventually lead to wrong actions.
  
  
  Tempting
  
  
  attractive, appealing, enticing
  seductive, alluring, inviting
  
  
  Tempt
  
  
  (transitive) To provoke someone to do wrong, especially by promising a reward; to entice. She tempted me to eat the apple.
  (transitive) To attract; to allure. Its glossy skin tempted me.
  (transitive) To provoke something; to court. It would be tempting fate.
  


But, as with many secular concepts that overlap religious concepts, there are often explicit theological definitions which allow the terminology to fit into religious, dogmatic, and theological discussions with less ambiguity. In this case, is there any predominating Christian/theological definition?

In particular, how is temptation defined or explained in such a manner that allows Christ to have been tempted?

To clarify the problem, if Christ is to be attracted to some thing, there must be some part or aspect of Christ to which some thing appeals. More significantly, Christ, in order to be tempted, must desire that thing if we are to say He is attracted to it. And if Christ is to contain a part or aspect to which some evil may be a temptation, thus arousing a desire, there could be said to be a sinful nature or component in Christ -- a contradiction of His Godliness.

To illustrate the problem, one might select magnetism (or any natural force) as a natural analogy. For the effect of magnetism (sin) to attract (tempt) a material (person), the material must contain, at least to some extent, a magnetic (sinful) component.

Thus, if we say that Christ is tempted in this understanding, we say that He has a sinful component.

How do we Christians, Catholics, or any denomination that has a well-established concept, define or explain temptation in a non-trivial manner without requiring Christ to have a sinful nature?
",svidgen,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/3410,"Temptation is one of those words that shows just how.... difficult English can be. 

I am assuming that when you talk about the temptations and Christ, you are talking about the temptations that were apart of his 40 day fast and the ones immediately following that fast?

Now the scripture in Matthew reads: 


  Matt 4: 1,3 ) 1. Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be *tempted [sic] of the devil. 3. And when the tempter came to him he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.


So we have Jesus going up to be tempted, and we have the tempter coming to Him once he is done. 

Now, as noted in your definitions, Temptation can be applied both as a adjective - when it describes a condition one is experiencing - and as a verb - when it describes an action. No where in these verses, does it apply temptation as an adjective that Christ is experiencing. In both verses it is being used in verbal form. First He is going out to be tempted, (be being key here to the verbal application of the word).

Then He is confronted with the tempter, again the verbal form of the word (though it can be confusing because here the verbal form is being used as a pronoun).

If you keep reading and come to Christ's responses, it is fairly evident that tempted is not a good adjective for how He feels when presented with the devil's offers.


  Matt 4: 4,7,10) 4.But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. 7. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. 10. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.


None of Christ's answers show any desire to partake of the temptations, or that they provoke any sense of allure in the Savior. In fact He rather forcefully rejects the offers and then casts the tempter out of His presence.

So TL:DR While Christ is presented (verbal form) with temptations, He never feels (adjectival form) the temptations. Hence He does not have a sinful nature. 



*As a side note, in verse 1 of my KJV of the bible the footnotes offer 'tried' or 'tested' as an alternate translation for 'tempted'. This seems to flow better with the fact that the devil shows up only after Christ comes back from the wilderness. (Again, that's just a note and my opinion on the whole scripture, and has nothing to do with my answer!)

5548,Why do objects fall at the same acceleration?,"I read these two posts and now I am more confused.

Do heavier objects fall faster?

Don&#39;t heavier objects actually fall faster because they exert their own gravity?

I was going to ask: if mass is an objects tendency to resist acceleration then why do two objects of different masses fall to the Earth at the same acceleration?

Then I read those posts and it seems that even though it is very small, the more massive object falls faster. Okay I understand, both objects attract each other.

If two cars of different masses collide doesn't the car with less mass accelerate more even though both cars received the same Force. Then that implies you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. Because that is how I see it, the Moon attracts the Earth with the same Force as the Earth attracts the Moon but the Earth accelerates less due to its larger mass.

So then how is mass an object's tendency to resist acceleration? I am aware of $F_1 = F_2 = GMm/r^2$. So should we not really be able to see the difference in acceleration when dropping a massive object?
",CharlieK,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/43959,"
  Mass is an object's tendency to resist acceleration.


This applies when both masses you're testing are subjected to identical forces. 

From Newton's Law of Gravity,

$$F = G \frac{M \cdot m}{r^2}$$

It is fairly obvious that the force the Earth exerts on a heavy body is more that what it exerts on a light body, so you can not compare the accelerations by comparing just the masses in this case.

Newton's second law gives $$a = \frac{F}{m} = G \frac{M}{r^2}$$

For two bodies an equal distance away from the Earth's center of mass, you can see that the acceleration for both bodies is indeed, the same and independent of the body mass.

Of course, this assumes there is no drag on the falling body, and that the only appreciable force is that due to Newton's Law.

To summarize: 

There is no difference in the acceleration of two objects of identical shape but different masses. The difference you observe between a feather and a golf ball, for example, is not because of gravity - it's because of the shape and the air resistance the body encounters.

Clarification This answer assumes you're in an inertial reference frame (attached to the center of mass of the falling object and the Earth), and that ""falling"" means the motion of the object towards this center of mass. 

If you consider falling to mean the motion of the object relative to the Earth, then, because the force exerted on the Earth by a heavier body is more, the Earth will accelerate towards the center of mass ever so slightly, and therefore the object will fall ever so slightly faster.

So, I have tried to do this myself in my own app, however I cannot change neiher the color nor the blinking internal of the LED. I currently use this code:

public class MainActivity extends Activity {
  static final int NOTIFICATION_ID = 1;

  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    button.setOnClickListener(buttonOnClick);

    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
      String ns = Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE;
      NotificationManager mNotificationManager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(ns);

      Notification notification = new Notification(R.drawable.icon, ""Hello"", System.currentTimeMillis());
      notification.flags = Notification.FLAG_SHOW_LIGHTS | Notification.FLAG_AUTO_CANCEL;
      notification.ledARGB = Color.BLUE;
      notification.ledOnMS = 1000;
      notification.ledOffMS = 300;

      Context context = getApplicationContext();
      CharSequence contentTitle = ""My notification"";
      CharSequence contentText = ""Hello World!"";
      Intent notificationIntent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, MainActivity.class);
      PendingIntent contentIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(MainActivity.this, 0, notificationIntent, 0);

      notification.setLatestEventInfo(context, contentTitle, contentText, contentIntent);

      mNotificationManager.notify(NOTIFICATION_ID, notification);
    }
  };
}


But as I said, it doesn't work the way I want it to; instead it just blinks in regular green with the default delay, and not the one I have set in my code.

Eclipse is an extremely clean filtered methanol solution, that leaves no residue on glass and other optics. Likewise, the Pec-Pads are a woven, lint-free disposable cloth that is excellent for cleaning optics. Unlike regular lens tissue, these are very absorbent, so you are not smearing solution around the lens. These are recommended as part of the 'copperhill method' of sensor cleaning, and a bottle/100 wipe pack will last you a lifetime of sensor cleaning, meaning there is plenty left over for critical lens cleaning.

Note that I use these products primarily in the home, prior to a shoot, or after a shoot. In the field, I use a lens brush, and a microfiber cloth for emergency purposes. I prefer to NOT touch the lens in any fashion in the field, but sometimes you can not avoid or prevent it.

I recommend the Giottos Rocket Blower, as it is inexpensive, and it has a filter on the intake, which helps reduce dust being blasted out of the blower onto your equipment. Note however that they can be kinda bulky, and its usually one of the first things to get tossed out of the bag if I am traveling light. Also, don't over think this: your mouth makes a workable blower in a pinch, and is dust free, though not necessarily liquid free (see cleaner above).

Decent ranking on certain targeted keywords.
An HTTPS-only policy, which uses 302 redirects to force clients onto the secure version of any URL.
Internal links using HTTPS, so there is no redirection.
Some, but not all, external links from other domains use HTTPS. The rest do not and will of course be subject to the 302.
Google is only indexing the HTTPS version of each URL. Even if you search specifically for the HTTP URL, only the HTTPS URL is shown in the results.


Will there be any significant, immediate ranking benefit to changing our site to use 301 redirects to enforce HTTPS? Are there any statements from Google, Matt Cutts or other authorities on this specific situation?

Based on my research the difference should be minimal since we are already well indexed, and our internal links are fine, so Google is not going to apply a sitewide penalty for the 302s, which are, in effect, only the first link in the chain.
",Jordan Rieger,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/27841,"I took a quick look at our latest keyword rankings report. This report is produced manually in-house based on the actual result rank we achieve for searches on Google for specific keyword phrases that we are targeting. (A top 10 rank is obviously desirable as it puts us on the first page of results, a top 6 is even better as it puts us above the fold on most monitors, and anything less than a top 50 is almost worthless because so few users click that far into the results.) Currently we are tracking 17 different phrases on a weekly basis. I think this report gives us the most direct way to measure our SEO results.

I compared our rankings on our August 2nd report to our August 15th report; the change went live on August 8th. The result is that out of 17 different phrases, only 2 improved in the rankings, 6 remained the same, and 9 decreased. Overall, the magnitude of the moves down and up were not terribly dramatic. Of course, in the time between the reports, we were also making the normal adjustments that any business makes to its content, and competitors were doing the same, so it's impossible to determine exactly how much difference the 301 made versus the 302 for us. But based on these results, the direct answer to my question about specific, immediate ranking benefit is that there probably is none. These results suggest that in the following situation, Google is smart enough to know that a 302 really means a 301:


302 is redirecting to the HTTPS version of the same URL
HTTP version is no longer accessible
Google search results are only showing HTTPS version, not HTTP
Google site tools still show some residual PageRank for the HTTP version (I discovered this after posting the question) possibly because external sites are still widely linking to your HTTP version


If your situation matches all the above criteria, there is reason to believe that Google is not penalizing you for the 302's. That agrees with the opinion of at least one SEO consultant company, who says: 


  Google recognizes that many people use 302 when they really mean 301.
  Fortunately, Google isn't bound by any law to take people literally.
  For the sake of producing the best possible search results, Google can
  and should look at 302s and figure out if the webmaster really means
  302, or if it's run-of-the-mill confusion and they really mean 301.


I would definitely like to see some more experiments 
situations where the 302 is consistently going to the HTTPS version of the exact same URL, and the HTTP version is no longer accessible. I found a similar experiment, with a slightly different situation, which proved that 302 does indeed confer some page rank, especially if the source and target pages are relevant to eachother. (In our situation, the pages were identical, which may explain why we were doing OK with the 302's.)

All that said, there is no good reason to use 302's for permanent redirects if you can help it, and we will be sticking with 301's. In our case, our ASP.Net code was doing the redirects via Response.Redirect(), and the default behavior in ASP.Net is to use a 302. Only with .NET 4.0 did Microsoft add a convenient Response.RedirectPemanent() method. Until then you had to manually write the 301 header, PHP-style, and most of our developers did not bother since they were used to redirects within application workflows, to which 302's are well suited. But we are happy to be using 301 redirects everywhere we can now.

6666,Why do I get the wrong result from this program to compute gross pay?,"This is actually a homework. Here is the question.


  Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay. Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use raw_input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input - assume the user types numbers properly.


I've tried this, but it doesn't work correctly.

hrs = raw_input(""Enter Hours:"")
h = float(hrs)
rate_hour = raw_input(""Enter rate:"")
r = float(rate_hour)
if h &lt;= 40:
    r = 1
else :
    r = 1.5
print h * r

This works correctly if the amount of hours is less than 40, but according to your question, what you have to do is -


if the person has worked more than 40 hours, pay 1 times for up to 40 hours, and then 1.5 times after 40 hours (that is total hours - 40).

8870,What does “sign the final flourish” mean?,"There was the following sentence in Time magazine’s a bit old  article (December 11, 2013) titled, “Pope Francis, the people’s Pope,” in which I was drawn to the phrase, “sign the final flourish”: 


  “He returned o Buenos Aires and looked to retirement. - - He handed
  his letter of resignation to the Pope when he turned 75 in 2011.”I’m
  starting to consider the fact that I have to leave everything behind,”
  he said in 2010. “It makes me want to be fair with everyone always, to
  sign the final flourish ... But death is my thought every day.” He
  insisted he was not sad, and he went on posing for pictures with the
  faithful.”
  
  http://poy.time.com/2013/12/11/person-of-the-year-pope-francis-the-peoples-pope/


I thought “sign the flourish” an idiom, but I don’t find the phrase in dictionaries I use to consult, or on Google.”  

I wondered if it’s similar with Japanese idiom, “一花咲かせる－hitohana sakaseru” meaning to bloom the last blossoms at the ending, at the last stage of one's career, or before retiring, like a baseball player who passed his peak hitting a streak of homeruns before retiring, but then, the word, “sign” seems to be incongruent.

Or, does “sign the flourish” mean “sign by using decorated-letters”?

2980,Looking for story where weather control makes snow fall once in warm climate,"I am looking for a very good story I read many years ago. The story was about a request to a politician that an old dying man would like to see snow fall before he died. The world now had weather control (maybe by controlling sunspots?) but he was in a warm climate (southern California?) and could not be moved and was near death. The man had been instrumental in the early days of weather control. I think the story starts by following the politician who decided to try to honor the man's request and passes a special bill thru the world legislature to make it happen. It then moves to a women (I think) in the weather service who needs to do something radical (in boats on the sun?) to make it happen. I think there were 3 vignettes but I'm forgetting one of them. The story ends with snow falling on 1 acre and the man gets to see the snow before he dies (which may occur at the end of the snowfall).

$vars['cal']=views_embed_view('calendar','calendar_1');


and then you would have $cal inside your template to use however you wanted.  If you needed this information inside of a node, eg in a text field that would be displayed between those paragraphs of other text, you could probably hook into nodeapi() and set it there on display of the node.  If you need it embeddable inside a field amongst other text, that gets trickier, but doable with a custom filter of your own (or http://drupal.org/project/customfilter might be able to do it with their php filter but I've not used it personally) but then you'd have something along the lines of [calendar] that your users could have inside of a text field that would be transformed into the calendar view output on view.

Regardless of any of the above, I have no idea what CSS style issues you would have to fiddle with, if any, or what to do with the previous and next links of the calendar and if they would also work or not as expected on this new page.

5102,Is a password easier to brute force if it contains a repeating pattern?,"My question is different from this previous question: Does repeating one word to form a password result in a similar pattern in its encrypted format?. I'm specifically wondering about brute force attacks. Based on my experiences with John The Ripper, I doubt that repeating a pattern in a password would shorten the time to successfully brute force a password like f00B@rf00B@rf00B@r as opposed to a random string of equal length. However, my doubt is based on the fact that, according to the documentation, JTR does not include a specific attack mode for repeating patterns. JTR, and presumably other brute force tools, can be customized for any arbitrary attack mode. But we can't know how often attackers bother to customize attacks in this way. So then the question becomes mathematical. Please forgive the awkward pseudo mathematical notation. 

T = brute force cracking time

PL = pattern of characters of length L

N = number of times PL is repeated

R(LN) = string of random characters of length (L times N)


Would it be true that

T(PL*N)= T(R(LN))


If true, then a repeating pattern password would not affect brute force cracking time. But is it true?
",Luke Sheppard,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/12057,"There are three scenarios here:

Attacker has no knowledge of the pattern scheme:
When the attacker has no knowledge of the patterns, the brute-force attempt will have to be exhaustive. The attacker gains no practical efficiency improvement, because there is no way of him knowing the construction of the password.

Attacker has some or full knowledge of the pattern scheme:
If the attacker has knowledge of the patterns, they may improve the efficiency of their bruteforce attack by not attempting passwords that do not match the pattern scheme.

Attacker has no initial knowledge of the pattern scheme, and multiple hashes are available:
If the attacker has no initial knowledge of the pattern, but has a number of different password hashes to crack (all of which use the same scheme for the password) he may crack a small number of them via exhaustive bruteforce, then deduce the pattern. From there, the attack becomes much more efficient.

1998,How to specify which resources to protect with Spring Security OAuth2 provider configuration,"I'm currently implementing a Spring MVC application that is both an OAuth client (in the sense that it consumes data from third party service providers), and an OAuth2 Service Provider (in the sense that it should provide the means for third party oauth clients to consume data from this application from a dedicated REST api). 

While I have no issue with the implementation of the application in its capacity as OAuth client, my OAuth2 service provider configuration is interfering with the applications ability to authenticate with service providers- if I enable the Oauth2 config, it appears to intercept callbacks to the application from third party service providers. Disabling it returns the application back to its normal working state.

I'm assuming that this is because I am not specifying which urls I want to the oauth2 provider to govern exclusively- but I can't see any way of specifying this. 

To simplify the question how do I configure Spring Security OAuth2 provider to manage one url root (e.g. '/restapi/*'), and this url only, with it ignoring all other urls entirely? I've had a look at the resources at the projects homepage, but nothing is jumping out at me... 

This may well be down to how I've defined my security intercept-urls, in which case it may not be an OAuth2 specific question, but how to apply different security schemes to different url schemes. Any advice on how to do that would be great!
",VLostBoy,https://stackoverflow.com/users/343343,"Out of the box you won't be able to do it with Spring Security 3.0, but you can in 3.1.   According to this blog post: 


  In Spring Security 3.1, you will be able to use more than one http
  element to create multiple filter chains. Each chain handles different
  paths within the application, for example a stateless API under the
  URL /rest/** and a stateful web application configuration for all
  other requests.


To do what you want you can subclass the provider security filters and override doFilter() to only apply to certain URLs.   

If you are using namespace configuration you'll need to have your subclassed filters replace the corresponding filter in the filter chain.  Kindof a pain, but doable. For example, here's how I am doing it for my custom VerificationCodeFilter:

override def afterPropertiesSet() {
  setVerificationServices(springVerificationCodeFilter.getVerificationServices)
  setClientDetailsService(springVerificationCodeFilter.getClientDetailsService)
  setUserApprovalHandler(springVerificationCodeFilter.getUserApprovalHandler)
  super.afterPropertiesSet()

7638,"highcharts: stop chart from trapping mouse events, or capture mouse click on the ENTIRE chart","All,

I'm using HighCharts in a web app I'm working on, and generally, I like it very much.

However, I'm having a hard time figuring out how capture a mouse click on the ENTIRE chart.

In other words - I'd like to know when the user clicks ANYWHERE on the chart (e.g., the plot area, the title, the x- or y-axis, the margins and padding around the chart elements, etc.)

Or, I'd like to disable events altogether, so I can trap the event in the container itself.

More detailed version...

I have a DIV that contains my HighChart.

I want to know if the user clicks ANYWHERE within that DIV.

So - initially I tried attaching an ""onclick"" event to the DIV, but that never gets fired, presumably because the click is getting trapped by the HighChart.

So, in the code that sets up the HighChart, I added this:

var chart = new Highcharts.Chart({
    chart: {
        renderTo: ""container"",
        events: {
            click: function(event) {
                // do something
            }
        },
        ...
    }
    ...
});


This works OK IF the user clicks somewhere within the plot area, but not if she clicks anywhere else in the chart (e.g., the x-axis, the y-axis, the title, the padding around the chart elements, etc.)

So - how can I make the ENTIRE chart clickable?

Many thanks in advance!
",mattstuehler,https://stackoverflow.com/users/49383,"I had this same issue.

Using the webkit inspector I can see that Highcharts binds a click event to the chart container (the div with the 'highcharts-container' class), and this seems to interfere with clicking.

Provided you don't want any of the functionality in that click event, you can remove it by setting 

chart.container.onclick = null;

Otherwise, you'll need to use the built-in highcharts event properties to set your callbacks.
As the OP noted, there is an 'events' property for the chart object, which should trigger when clicking the plot background. 
There is also an event property for the plot options which triggers when clicking the series itself. 

For example, for area plots:

var chart = new Highcharts.Chart({
    ...
    plotOptions: {
        area: {
            events: {
                click: function(event) {
                    // do something
                }
            },
        ...
        }
    }
    ...

Yet, Lars (not sure if Beru saw him during ANH) never recognizes C-3PO in the first part of A New Hope, despite presumably having lived with him during the time of Shmi Skywalker's marriage to Cliegg Lars.

It just doesn't make sense, because:

1) The only reason Owen would not recognize C-3PO is if 3PO is, as suggested, one of a mass-produced series of droids.  However...

2) C-3PO was not part of a mass-produced line, he was hand-built by Darth Vader.

3) He really should've had a clue when R2 started talking about Obi-Wan, the guy who OWNED the droids last time he saw them, but he just gives some vague response when questioned by Luke, rather than desperately trying to get rid of the droids.

4) C-3PO should have recognized Owen and Beru, unless his memory had been wiped.  However...

5) He remembers his first job, so his memory has not been wiped.

6) So, how do the droids not even remember who Obi-Wan is when the message is recorded?

There really is no decent explanation beyond rushed writing and production of the movies so that the associated toys could hit the shelves.

8137,Ethical Disclosure of Professional Knowledge in PhD Dissertation,"I have just completed my PhD. Although my examiners did not raise any concerns, I have been grappling with an ethical issue for the entire duration of my candidature. 

The issue concerns professional knowledge of the field on which my research is based. This is an issue of concern because I am employed in the field and have access to information that is generally not publicly available (but is available to me as an employee) or only found in hard-to-get industry publications (e.g. newsletters). These publications are hard-to-get because of their specialised nature and limited circulation. 

Disclosing this information creates a potential conflict of interest for me (because of reasons associated with commercial-in-confidence, breach of trust etc.). It gets even worse because I am often actively involved in generating this information as part of various negotiations I am required to have with third parties (in my capacity as an employee). As an example, I draft policy speeches for my CEO so this has the effect of quoting my own work in my dissertation (but attributed to my CEO in the citation and bibliography!)  

To resolve this matter, I have declared (categorically) this conflict of interest (several times in my dissertation) (although I don't identify myself as the ghost writer). I have also put whatever information I thought could be ethically disclosed in the relevant context (e.g. cited the publicly available newsletter, where possible). This was to ensure future researchers could benefit from this 'inside' knowledge. I have stated this as one of the contributions to knowledge that my dissertation is making.

I must add that the professional knowledge does not contradict or undermine my research, so I am certainly not withholding the information for this reason. On the contrary, this information enhances the main arguments of my study (so omitting it presents a significant dilemma for me).

i would love to hear how else could this matter be resolved.

6222,Trigger IP ban based on request of given file?,"I run a website where ""x.php"" was known to have vulnerabilities. The vulnerability has been fixed and I don't have ""x.php"" on my site anymore.

As such with major public vulnerabilities, it seems script kiddies around are running tools that hitting my site looking for ""x.php"" in the entire structure of the site - constantly, 24/7.

This is wasted bandwidth, traffic and load that I don't really need.

Is there a way to trigger a time-based (or permanent) ban to an IP address that tries to access ""x.php"" anywhere on my site?

Perhaps I need a custom 404 PHP page that captures the fact that the request was for ""x.php"" and then that triggers the ban? How can I do that?

Thanks!

EDIT:

I should add that part of hardening my site, I've started using ZBBlock:

  to detect certain behaviors
  detrimental to websites, or known bad
  addresses attempting to access your
  site. It then will send the bad robot

9185,Does becoming martyr have an evolutionary advantage?,"This is related to 
How does &quot;be altruist to those who are similar to you&quot; evolve?

Altruism that is


Not reciprocal
Not familiar


has little explanation. One possible explanation is that the trait itself may correlate well with genetics. One great answer there is that often the cost of altruism is small anyway. It can explain why people vote. Here the expense is small anyway.

Still there seems to be some factors that are even bigger.

Let's take a look at people that die for their ideology. Christian martyrs, Muslim suicide bombers, or Communist guerilla fighters. They seem to get so little and well, die.

And that's pretty common. It seems pretty easy for a leader or pedagogue to rouse men to be soldiers. Of course, becoming a soldier is a pretty shitty job, yet most men don't mind.

These people make a huge sacrifice for the sake of their country, ideology, or people that are not even genetically related to them.

Why?
",J. Chang,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/554,"There isn an effect called ""Indirect reciprocity"" where individuals just give to everyone they meet without direct requirement of reciprocity.  

This sort of benefit to others is common - hospitality to strangers, general politeness, good customer service all fall along these lines.  You hope they will come back and benefit you again, but maybe they will tell someone else who will know you are a good community member. 

It is only sustainable in a system where the cost/benefit ratio is less than the reputation benefit of the act.  It sounds as if this is only good for public acts but if the benefit is transferred to a social entity that outlasts the individual (like your children, a relative's children, a religion or a corporation say), the result could still hold.  

If you think about typical morality/ethics really it still makes sense to think that what we call altruism must still have a net positive benefit.  If there is no benefit long term or to anyone, it really isn't useful or even good, its random.  What we usually call altruism is usually some sort of reciprocal cooperation.  

A soldier who dies in combat or someone who dies for their beliefs but everyone knows about it as a public statement benefits from their act indirectly.  I don't think its altruism in the pure sense of the word. Defending the nation, ones' beliefs or whatever is, in its sense its own reward.  Veterans come back from a war are hopefully respected for their work.  Having a purple heart can be a good thing to show people.  I'm not saying these people are adequately compensated for what they have been through, but just trying to draw a distinction between pure biological altruism and 'indirect reciprocity'.

Examples of Indirect reciprocity might be the use of tax money to build highways and build power and water infrastructure.  Its important - its the glue that holds a nation or a group together.  If you got punished for doing these things we wouldn't be hanging as a nation very long!

A martyr with no family at all who would benefit would still count as an altruism I think, but most acts of public piety and sacrifice do benefit the individual by reputation. Something to think about.

WARNING! Spoilers Below!

If you haven't watched the series but plan to, you might not want to read what follows. I tried to separate setting spoilers from the system requirements, but it just didn't work.


The world is gritty and the power level is relatively low. It reminded me of Wild Cards, with ""the storm"" as the catalyzing event. Therefore, the system must support fine gradations in power - the scale is pretty low, so a small advantage needs to be representable.
Powers are uncontrollable - at least at first. Alisha's lust-inspiring power is uncontrolled as far as I have watched, and the immortality power (obviously) works without conscious effort. Curtis' time rewind is a power of huge significance, but it's not controlled by the beginning of the second season either. Therefore the system must support uncontrolled and unreliable powers.
The system you recommend must support regular humans as significant combat threats - Sally gave Simon a real fight. Player character death must be a real possibility.
This is also an ensemble drama, like Buffy, and much of the story is about the changing relationships between the characters.

  If $N$ is smooth manifolds and $F: M \to N$ is a smooth map, for each $p \in M$ we define a map $F_*: T_pM \to T_{F(p)}N$, called the push-forward associated with $F$, by
  $$(F_*X)(f) = X(f \circ F).$$

",Tumbleweed,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/77895,"It often times just helps to write out exactly what the formula you are trying to get in the end looks like, and then interpreting that.

For example, you are trying to show that $F_\ast(\alpha X)=\alpha F_\ast(X)$. So, what does the left-hand side do to elements of $T_{F(p)}N$? Well, as you pointed out

$F_\ast(\alpha X)(f)=(\alpha X)(f\circ F)$

what does the right-hand side look like?

$(\alpha F_\ast(X))(f)=\alpha F_\ast(X)(f)=\alpha X(f\circ F)$

Make sense?

EDIT(to answer Jellybean's questions in the comment): I am not entirely sure what you mean here. The tangent space of $M$ at $p$ is thought of, or at least the book you're reading thinks of it, as the $\mathbb{R}$-derivations of germs of smooth functions $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ at $p$. A smooth map $F:M\to N$ allows one to take a derivation $X$ of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ and ""push it forward"" to a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. The way it does this is basically the observation that if you start with an element of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$, germs of smooth functions on $N$ at $F(p)$, there is a way to pull this back to an element of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$. Namely, if $f\in\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ then $f\circ F\in\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$. Thus, if you start with a derivation $X$ of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ you want to use this to produce a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. 

But, a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ eats in, well, obviously, elements of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. Thus, $X$ itself doesn't act on $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. But, we observed above that we have a method of taking an element of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ and pulling it back to an element of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$, which is the set of things that $X$ does eat. So, to create a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$, which let's call $F_\ast(X)$, of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ we merely take an element of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$, pull it back to $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ by the rule $f\mapsto f\circ F$, and now that we're back on $X$'s diningroom table we feed it to $X$ to get a real number out. Thus, the derivation $F_\ast(X)$ all put together acts as $f\mapsto f\circ F\mapsto X(f\circ F)$. You can check that this definition of $F_\ast(X)$ does, in fact, produce a a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. 

Thus, the association $X\mapsto F_\ast(X)$ produces a map $F_\ast:T_p M\to T_{F(p)}N$. This map, the map $F_\ast$, is the pushforward. It is a linear map between tangent spaces.

466,Update UIProgressView on UITableViewCell,"At the moment I got my main tableview with cells, which are loaded from a XML and filled up. After that I can click on one cell and a detailview is loaded(xib file, loaded through code in the main tableview). On the detailview I can click a download button and some files are downloaded asynchron to the documents folder. Then I pop the view down and I see again my tableview.

My idea now is to see the progress of the download in the tableview cell. I set up a uiprogressview on every cell, which is hidden on default. I now want to see the progress bar when I start the download. How can I do that? 

I tried something with performSelectorOnMainThread and a selector, which change the progress of my selected cell(which I assign in the main tableview). Seems to be a bad idea - didnt work.

Some ideas how to do that?



EDIT2: Some piece of code of my solution, ATTENTION! This is not the real code, I deleted a lot of lines for inserting here. There arent all releases etc. I think the solution is really dirty, but I didnt found a better solution for me...

Some important things:


cellDownloading: Array which knows
every cell which is downloading at
the moment
progressDictionary: Knows the progress of every cell
cellDictionary: Knows every cell, filled up in the cellsForRowAtIndexpath delegte of the tableview


I also cant copy the whole code, because there is a lot which have nothing to do with the whole process, but I give you the important steps.
My cells are created through parsing a xml, so every cell has got a setId in my case.

//////////////////
// Downloader.mm
//////////////////

method to download asynchron

-(void)startAsynchronousDownload:(NSString*)path{    

// generate notification
NSMutableDictionary *userInfo = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
NSNumber *tmpSetId = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:setId];

[userInfo setObject:tmpSetId forKey:@""setId""];

NSNotification* notification = [NSNotification notificationWithName:@""downloadStackNotification"" object:self userInfo:userInfo];  
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotification:notification];  

// add some infos...
NSMutableDictionary *dictionary = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
[dictionary setObject:tmpSetId forKey:@""setId""];
// perhaps more here

// asynchronous download handling
NSOperationQueue *queue = [NSOperationQueue alloc] init];
NSInvocationOperation *operation = [[NSInvocationOperation alloc] initWithTarget:self selector:@selector(downloadImagesWithDictionary:) object:dictionary];

// release
[operation release];
[dictionary release];
[userInfo release];
}


In my example the selector downloadImagesWithDictionary downloads some images, for every downloaded image I send a notification. Every stack of images have a setId in my case.

[...]
    NSMutableDictionary *userInfo = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
    NSNumber *sliceCounter = [NSNumber numberWithInt:i];
    NSNumber *amount = [NSNumber numberWithInt:amountOfImages];
    NSNumber *tmpSetId = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:setId];

    [userInfo setObject:sliceCounter forKey:@""actualImage""];
    [userInfo setObject:amount forKey:@""allImages""];
    [userInfo setObject:tmpSetId forKey:@""setId""];
    NSNotification* notification = [NSNotification notificationWithName:@""downloadSliceNotification"" object:self userInfo:userInfo];  
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotification:notification ];  
[...]


////////////////////////////
// TableViewController.mm
////////////////////////////

Now we need to get the notifications to update our tableview

[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(downloadSliceNotification:) name:@""downloadSliceNotification"" object:nil];
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(downloadStackNotification:) name:@""downloadStackNotification"" object:nil];


We need a cell dictionary to know all indexpath of our existing tableview cells.
Fill them in the cellForRowAtIndexPath delegate

[cellDictionary setObject:indexPath forKey:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%d"",cellSetId]];


Now we create the handler to do somehting if we got a notification
First the handler if the download starts
I have got a progress dictionary which knows every progress of every cell
I can identify every cell by the setId - perhaps u have to change that a little bit

- (void)downloadStackNotification:(NSNotification*)notification {  
NSDictionary *userInfo = [notification userInfo];
NSNumber *setId = [userInfo objectForKey:@""setId""];

NSNumber *progress = [NSNumber numberWithInt:0];    
[progressDictionary setObject:progress forKey:[setId stringValue]];

// add cell to downloadlist
[cellDownloading addObject:[setId stringValue]];


} 

Now for every download step(in my case one image). 
Calculate process and update the dictionary, get the cell to update the progress

- (void)downloadSliceNotification:(NSNotification*)notification {  
NSDictionary *userInfo = [notification userInfo];
NSNumber *sliceCounter = [userInfo objectForKey:@""actualImage""];
NSNumber *amount = [userInfo objectForKey:@""allImages""]; 
NSNumber *setId = [userInfo objectForKey:@""setId""]; 

NSNumber *progress = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:(100/[amount floatValue])*[sliceCounter floatValue]];      

[progressDictionary setObject:progress forKey:[setId stringValue]];
NSIndexPath* indexPath = [cellDictionary objectForKey:[setId stringValue]];

CustomServerCell* cell = (CustomServerCell*)[self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath];
NSMutableDictionary *downloadData = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
[downloadData setObject:cell forKey:@""cell""];
[downloadData setObject:sliceCounter forKey:@""actualImage""];
[downloadData setObject:amount forKey:@""allImages""];

[self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(updateProgressWithDictionary:) withObject:downloadData waitUntilDone:NO];
} 


Update the cell

-(void)updateProgressWithDictionary:(NSMutableDictionary*)downloadData {

CustomServerCell* cell = (CustomServerCell*)[downloadData objectForKey:@""cell""];
NSNumber *sliceCounter = [downloadData objectForKey:@""actualImage""];
NSNumber *amount = [downloadData objectForKey:@""allImages""];

cell.progressView.hidden = FALSE;
NSNumber *tmpProgress = [progressDictionary objectForKey:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%d"",cell.progressView.tag]];
cell.progressView.progress = [tmpProgress floatValue]/100;
cell.statusLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""download slice %d / %d"",[sliceCounter integerValue],[amount integerValue]];

7066,Is it ethical to profit by having my students buy my textbook?,"This question was suggested to me by How can I sell my text book to my students in e-book format? which asked about the practicalities, but attracted many comments about the ethics.  So this question is to ask about the ethics directly.

Suppose I have written and published a textbook, and I want to use it as the text for a course I am teaching.  I receive royalties from each copy of my book that is sold, so if my students are required to buy my textbook for the course, I will make some money.  Is it ethical to do so?

Well-reasoned opinions would be useful answers, but even more useful would be pointers to institutional policies, professional codes of ethics, etc, that address this issue.

Of course, there are many ways to avoid profiting from the sale of my book to my students.  If my contract with my publisher allows it, I could distribute PDFs to my students, or have the university bookstore print out copies and sell them at cost.  Another approach I've heard of is to compute how much I earn in royalties on each copy, and refund that amount from my pocket to each student who buys a copy.  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.  Certainly these are nice gestures, but I would like opinions on whether they are ethically required.

Edit: To address some questions that have arisen in the comments:


This question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.
I had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) ""blows"", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  
I don't literally mean that students would be required to buy the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.

",Nate Eldredge,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/1010,"Short answer: I think it is neither ethical nor good (in terms of education, independent of ethics) to force students to use your textbook.

(Assuming that we are talking about a ""normal"" lecture, as opposed to a workshop about your book.)



Long answer: I see 3 different (but connected) difficulties here. None of them needs to be a problem, but together, they can trap the students. 


requiring a particular textbook: to me this is less of an ethical problem if it doesn't boil down to forcing the students to buy that particular book.
Nevertheless, I think it preferable from an education point of view to teach students that they left the kind of school where exactly one solution exists, and now they are in a world with lots of sensible alternatives. Giving  recommendations* (plural!), IMHO it is a most important point to make that the library holds even more useful books [also on that topic].
more or less forcing students to buy a textbook  


(Recall that the origin of ""lecture"" is that a (text)book was read to the students. So historically, the lecture was a solution to the problem that books were too expensive for students to buy.)


I don't see why buying the textbook is necessary. Even if book and lecture are (naturally) close. 


  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them


Why would that be:


Is is that difficult to prepare a slide of the homework problem which is displayed at the end of the lecture or a pdf that can be downloaded?
Reading: I have to say that at university I've never experienced assigned reading from a textbook. So my question to you is: is it really necessary to assign reading chapter 7.4 as opposed to assign preparing the principles of pH electrodes? Also, I've seen reading materials for download.
Making small parts of the book available to the students is probably possible even if the contract with the publisher doesn't let you distribute pdfs to the students. At least, e.g. in Germany, it is even possible to hand small parts from any book (not only yours!) to the class for teaching purposes.
For the self-study aspect of the textbook, there is the textbook collection of the library. The university libraries I know have sensible numbers of the important textbooks to be borrowed by the students plus a number of copies that stay in the library so they are always accessible.  Are the books there really not sufficient? If so, why not? Why are the important books not there? How can books be bought?
(How to get your book into the collection is part of the next point:)

Possible conflict of interest because it is your own textbook.
This is the interesting part. But, if you take care of the first two problems, there is already much less space for an actual conflict of interest (≈ a real problem for the students) here.
Or, taking another point of view, I perceive taking unfair advantage of the position***  as a symptom of (un)ethical behaviour which is closely bound to the whole character. In that I perceive it less of a single problem that is solved or not by a particular line of action on this point but rather a problem that appears with some people and not with others.
In yet other words, people who take advantage of their position tend to do that in more ways than just this (e.g. in the combination of my three points - at which point @JeffE probably recommends to run). The formal action of not requiring their own textbook doesn't help much. Students will conclude from the general reputation/perception of taking unfair advantage that the book is required - whether it is stated openly or not. 


I guess it is one of the topics where those who do worry whether what they do is ethical are the ones who don't need to worry (because they do act ethically) - it would be far more important that those who don't would start to worry...

Whether to donate copies of your own textbook to the library, 
make a donation that reimburses the library for your royalties, or 
convince the library to buy it like any other book, and/or 
whether and how you want to reimburse students 
is IMHO unanswerable as a general question.
I think valid points can be made for and against** each of the options here.

Good and sensible decisions will depend a lot on the particular circumstances and even more on the personality of the professor.



Side note: 


  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.


I object to this option on the following ethical grounds: If my problem is that I'm too poor to buy textbooks, I don't want to spend money on pizza but would rather like to save that money towards the next textbook. 



* A professor not recommending his own textbook sounds about as convincing to me as a vegetarian running a sausage factory. 

** Here's the advocatus diaboli against each of the points:


Donating books to the library? Someone is buying fame!
Reimbursing the royalties - same as above, but more greedy (or the one above was more desperate for fame...)
Convinced some committee to buy the books? Surely there is a textbook-buying circle emerging: You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.  
reimbursing students who buy the book: that's an obvious attempt to whitewash the reputation
and so on


*** As long as you do not take advantage of your situation, the conflict of interest is at most your problem (i.e. you are worried). If you take unfair advantage, the students have a problem.

&lt;/script&gt;

Right so that's all cool - and it updates the OUTPUT div on the page with ""Got this from the server: 0""

I need a PHP function called ""my_action_callback"" - so in my theme's functions.php I have the following:

function my_action_callback() {

 $whatever = $_POST['whatever'];

 $whatever += 10;

    echo 'whatever now equals: ' . $whatever;

 die();
}


This is the ONLY function in my functions.php

To make sure the PHP function is working I stick my_action_callback() into my index.php - and it outputs ""whatever now equals: 10"" as expected.

HOWEVER - the AJAX response is always 'Got this from the server: 0'
Ajax never seems to get the response from the PHP function. 

I tried adding .ajaxError() to see if there were any errors - nope.

I tried adding the PHP functions to another plugin of mine - nope.

What am I missing that jQuery isn't doing the ajax bit for me?

Thanks in advance
",keranm,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/1107,"Put those add_action functions in your functions.php file too. If they're in header.php, WordPress never registers them since header isn't loaded in AJAX. Also, you don't need that is_admin() check. The theme's header will never load in admin. So, your functions file should look like this:

add_action('wp_ajax_my_special_action', 'my_action_callback');
add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_my_special_action', 'my_action_callback');
function my_action_callback() {

 $whatever = $_POST['whatever'];

 $whatever += 10;

    echo 'whatever now equals: ' . $whatever;

 die();
}


And the beginning of that part of your theme's header file should look like this:

&lt;?php
$_ajax = admin_url('admin-ajax.php');
?&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" &gt;

7918,Drywall - final joint compound coat,"While remodeling an older house (where nothing is quite straight) we used fiber glass mesh joint tape and 3 coats of joint compound. The first coat was applied with a 4 inch knife, the second with an 8 inch and ending the third on a 12 inch knife. I can still see the texture from the mesh tape I used on some of the joints.

I hoped that a coat of primer would level it off, but after using Kilz 2 primer I can still see the tape in some spots. :(

Sanding through the primer now proves difficult (doesn't work) with a medium grit sanding block.

Should I add another coat? I could never quite get the joint compound to adhere over the mesh tape. I've always been taught to go as thin as I can on the joint compound to reduce the sanding part. Did I go too thin? 

I'm hoping a second coat of primer and 2 coats of the final latex paint hides it, but I know this isn't the right answer. How can I fix this?



following what doresoom and shirlock said; i just applied a coat with the 12 inch knife practically against the wall (accidentally touching the wall with the handle once or twice) - more or less dragging the compound across the surface

this produced the result explained - about 1/32nd ? thickness of mud, covering the tape that i'll need to feather round the edges

i miss spoke earlier - i was using a sponge sanding block (not strait paper sand paper)

now that the primer has dried (did it saturday) its not as bad as i thought it was, but this is the right way to do it (not covering it with paint)

just as a side, we've used sherwin williams paint throughout the house and although its great paint (IMO) the plaster and lath walls that remain, even those repairs show through - and if those do, than this new work will... may as well do finish it right...

thanks for the help guys - i'll check this coat tomorrow and give a last one with the soap and water if it needs it.
",lsiunsuex,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/1154,"As the others have said, paint will not help your situation.  You will need to apply another coat of mud. The final coat can be applied using a 12 inch flat knife, but I personally like a 14 or 16 inch bow trowel. The idea is to have a thicker coat of mud over the tape and bevel or feather the edges out wide so you will not notice the small difference in thickness.  With a 12 inch knife, your joint should be about 16 to 18 inches wide. Push harder on the outside of the knife than on the inside/center of the joint. This will leave more mud in the center and feather the edges better. Do this on each side of the joint. 

Here is another tip for you.  For your last or final touch-up coat, mix a little extra water and some Ivory dish soap into your mud.  It will flow very easily, far less tiny air bubbles, and will sand out easy with little pressure. Never use sandpaper, use a 150 or 220 sanding sponge. Don't go crazy and strip it too much or you will expose the tape again. Smooth the center gently and feather out the edges more agressively.   Good luck

9554,Do volcano blast changes earth's course?,"Volcano blasts are one of the most powerful calamities on earth. When they blast they release large amount of mass in the air just like a jet does. Does such a blast have any effect on the course of the Earth? Does it change the Earth's orbit in any way? If not then how big a blast is needed to do it? Would a full eruption of the Yellowstone Supervolcano do it?
",Dimensionless,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/9023,"I do not think volcanic eruptions can change the course of the earth.

This is because whatever materials a volcano ejects ultimately land back to the ground, so the earth remains on its path. So no change in course/radius.

If, however, you can manage to create a blast which sends particles with such a force and such a speed that they never come back again (the speed will have to be $\geq 11.2 km/s$), then we can think about the change of course of the earth. Can Yellowstone do it?

But even if that DOES happen, the mass which it will be able to eject completely out of earth's gravitational field will be very less compared to the mass of the earth. So we can neglect and tiny change, since it's almost nothing. However, if a volcano could blast off even $1/10^{th}$s of the earth's mass, then we'd have some change in course/radius.



Addendum: I just thought of one thing though-
The material thrown up in a volcanic eruption emerges from inside the earth. When the eruption is over and the material is back on the ground, there has been a slight net displacement of the materials. What was first a few kilometres under the surface is now lying on the surface. Therefore, there may as well be a tiny change in course. 

HOWEVER, as pointed out before, the mass thrown up by a volcano is very very very less compared to the mass of the earth and the displacement of the material is very very less compared to the radius of the earth ($\approx 6400 km$), we can safely neglect this tiny change in course.
Even if there is a change, the radius of the earth's orbit around the sun is 150,000,000 km. A change in course by a fraction of a centimetre will make NO difference at all.



Addendum-2: Akash points out that the materials striking the ground don't apply the same force as the force at which the volcano erupts.   

That is not true. It may seem that the force is less, but that is because the materials are fragmented and a lot of the force is applied onto air too.
The force is distributed between all the particles and the air. When each particle strikes, it imparts its force to the earth. The air 'falls' back too, applying a force too. If you add up the forces, it will be equal to the force of the volcano.
Unless, of course, the materials are propelled out of the earth's gravitational field.

",ZHDarkstar,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/16224,"You can give fall damage by jumping in the air while grapling. You both would recieve fall damage and be prone unless an ability like slow fall or feather fall says otherwise. 

However, the barbarian is not best way to achieve your goal.  The best way to pull off a pile driver like you are describing would be with a Monk/Druid.  You only need to multiclass one level of Druid at level 2 in order to get access to helpful spells like longstrider, jump, and Guidance. The Monk gives you useful features like Slow Fall(reduce fall damage), Step of the Wind (use dash as a bonus action), and Extra Attack. Be a human, so you can get a bonus feat as a level one monk (if your DM allows). I would get the Athlete feat to start with and grab the Mobile feat at level 5 (remember you have to wait cause of the one level of multiclass into druid at level 2)

Here is the full pile driver combo,you grapple a target and then make a standing high jump. At the top of your jump, you hurl them to the ground, deal damage to them from the fall, knock them prone with no save, and then just re-grapple them in the same turn. This works by using the Jump spell to triple your jump distance, Step of the Wind to double it, and then stacking move speed bonuses so you can get to maximum height even with half move speed. Here's how it works assuming a base speed of 50 (30 + Longstrider 10 + unarmored Monk 10) and assuming you have Extra Attack.

Start next to your opponent and grapple them with the attack action (attack #1).

Take the Step of the Wind bonus action to Dash and to double your jump distance. Your move speed is now 50 for the turn (50 base / 2 grappled * 2 Dash).

Take a 5 foot step (45 remaining) to trigger Athletic.

LEAP FOR THE HEAVENS. Your jump height is massive at 36 (3 base + 3 strength = 6 * 3 Jump = 18 * 2 Step = 36 feet). Carry your opponent with you as you jump straight up.

At the top of your arc, release the grapple. And by ""release the grapple"", I mean hurl that poor guy back to the ground with a mighty heave.

Opponent falls and takes 3d6 damage, landing prone with no save.

You fall and take 3d6 - 5x Monk Level damage (assuming Slow Fall at level 4).

If you take no damage, use your remaining attack action from Extra Attack to re-grapple the prone target (attack #2)

If you take damage and land prone, use 5 feet of movement to stand from Athletic, and then regrapple the prone target.

BONUS: If your DM lets you, just land on your target; he should take 3d6 damage again from your fall.

I got this combo from the WotC Forums. The guide is called the Grappler's Manual.

  At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are short swords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.


Now for the Tavern Brawler feat it states that:


  You are proficient with improvised weapons and unarmed strikes.


And the rules for improvised weapons are:


  In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus. An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage. 


If the improvised weapon does not resemble a weapon, is simple, and is not heavy or two-handed, could a monk replace the d4 dice? For example if the monk is level 6 and has a unarmed attack of a d6, with a d6 dice instead?

5243,"Is there a ""covariant derivative"" for conformal transformation?","A primary field is defined by its behavior under a conformal transformation $x\rightarrow x'(x)$:
$$\phi(x)\rightarrow\phi'(x')=\left|\frac{\partial x'}{\partial x}\right|^{-h}\phi(x)$$

It's fairly easy to see that the gradient of the field doesn't have this nice property under the same transformation, it gets a non homogeneous term. Still, is it possible to construct a derivative that would behave nicely under conformal mappings and give the usual derivative for Lorentz transformations? By adding a ""connection"" similarly as what is done in general relativity or gauge theories. And if not, why?
",Learning is a mess,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/16890,"I) Here we discuss the problem of defining a connection on a conformal manifold $M$. We start with a conformal class $[g_{\mu\nu}]$ of globally$^{1}$ defined metrics 

$$\tag{1} g^{\prime}_{\mu\nu}~=~\Omega^2 g_{\mu\nu}$$

given by Weyl transformations/rescalings. Under mild assumption about the manifold $M$ (para-compactness), we may assume that there exists a conformal class $[A_{\mu}]$ of globally defined co-vectors/one-forms connected via Weyl transformations as

$$\tag{2} A^{\prime}_{\mu}~=~A_{\mu} + \partial_{\mu}\ln(\Omega^2). $$

In particular it is implicitly understood that a Weyl transformation [of a pair $(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})$ of representatives] act in tandem/is synchronized with the same globally defined function $\Omega$ in eqs. (1) and (2) simultaneously.

II) Besides Weyl transformations, we can act (in the active picture) with diffeomorphisms. Locally, in the passive picture, the pair $(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})$ transforms as covariant tensors

$$ \tag{3} g_{\mu\nu}~=~ \frac{\partial  x^{\prime \rho}}{\partial x^{\mu}} g^{\prime}_{\rho\sigma}\frac{\partial  x^{\prime \sigma}}{\partial x^{\nu}},  $$

$$ \tag{4} A_{\mu}~=~ \frac{\partial  x^{\prime \nu}}{\partial x^{\mu}} A^{\prime}_{\nu}. $$

under general coordinate transformations 

$$ \tag{5} x^{\mu} ~\longrightarrow~ x^{\prime \nu}~= ~f^{\nu}(x). $$

III) We next introduce the unique torsionfree tangent-space Weyl connection $\nabla$ with corresponding Christoffel symbols $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ that covariantly preserves the metric in the following sense:

$$ \tag{6} (\nabla_{\lambda}-A_{\lambda})g_{\mu\nu}~=~0. $$

The Weyl connection $\nabla$ and its Christoffel symbols $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ are independent of the pair $(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})$ of representatives within the conformal class $[(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})]$. (But the construction depends of course on the conformal class $[(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})]$.) In other words, the Weyl Christoffel symbols are invariant under Weyl transformations 

$$ \tag{7} \Gamma^{\prime\lambda}_{\mu\nu}~=~\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}.$$ 

The lowered Weyl Christoffel symbols are uniquely given by

$$ \Gamma_{\lambda,\mu\nu}~=~g_{\lambda\rho}  \Gamma^{\rho}_{\mu\nu} $$
$$ ~=~\frac{1}{2}\left((\partial_{\mu}-A_{\mu})g_{\nu\lambda} +(\partial_{\nu}-A_{\nu})g_{\mu\lambda}-(\partial_{\lambda}-A_{\lambda})g_{\mu\nu} \right) $$
$$\tag{8} ~=~\Gamma^{(g)}_{\lambda,\mu\nu}+\frac{1}{2}\left(A_{\mu}g_{\nu\lambda}-A_{\nu}g_{\mu\lambda}+A_{\lambda}g_{\mu\nu} \right), $$

where $\Gamma^{(g)}_{\lambda,\mu\nu}$ denote the lowered Levi-Civita Christoffel symbols for the representative $g_{\mu\nu}$. 
The lowered Weyl Christoffel symbols $\Gamma_{\lambda,\mu\nu}$ scale under Weyl transformations as

$$ \tag{9} \Gamma^{\prime}_{\lambda,\mu\nu}~=~\Omega^2\Gamma_{\lambda,\mu\nu}.$$ 

The corresponding determinant bundle has a Weyl connection given by

$$ \tag{10} \Gamma_{\lambda}~=~\Gamma^{\mu}_{\lambda\mu}~=~(\partial_{\lambda}-A_{\lambda})\ln \sqrt{\det(g_{\mu\nu})}.$$

IV) Let us next define a conformal class $[\rho]$ of a density $\rho$ of weights $(w,h)$, who scales under Weyl transformations as

$$  \tag{11} \rho^{\prime}~=~ \Omega^w\rho $$

with Weyl weight $w$, and as a density

$$\tag{12} \rho^{\prime}~=~\frac{\rho}{J^h}$$

of weight $h$ under general coordinate transformations (5). Here

$$\tag{13} J ~:=~\det(\frac{\partial x^{\prime \nu}}{\partial x^{\mu}}) $$

is the Jacobian. 

Example: The determinant $\det(g_{\mu\nu})$ is a density with $h=2$ and $w=2d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the manifold $M$.

V) The concept of (conformal classes of) densities $\rho$ of weights $(w,h)$ can be generalized to (conformal classes of) tensor densities $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$ of weights $(w,h)$ in a straightforward manner. For instance, a vector density  of weights $(w,h)$ transforms as

$$ \tag{14} \xi^{\prime \mu}~=~ \frac{1}{J^h}\frac{\partial  x^{\prime \mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}} \xi^{\nu} $$

under general coordinate transformations (5), and scales as 

$$ \tag{15} \xi^{\prime \mu}~=~\Omega^w \xi^{\mu} $$

under Weyl transformations. Similarly, a co-vector density of weights $(w,h)$ transforms as

$$ \tag{16} \eta^{\prime}_{\mu}~=~ \frac{1}{J^h}\frac{\partial x^{\nu}}{\partial  x^{\prime \mu}} \eta_{\nu} $$

under general coordinate transformations (5), and scales as 

$$ \tag{17} \eta^{\prime}_{\mu}~=~\Omega^w \eta_{\mu} $$

under Weyl transformations. And so forth for arbitrary tensor densities $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$.

Example: The metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ is a tensor density with $h=0$ and $w=2$. The one-form $A_{\mu}$ is not a tensor density, cf. eq. (2). 

VI) Finally, one can discuss the definition of covariantly conserved (conformal classes of) tensor densities $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$. A density $\rho$ of weights $(w,h)$ is covariantly conserved if

$$\tag{18} (\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\rho~\equiv~ (\partial_{\lambda}-h \Gamma_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\rho~=~0. $$

A vector density of weights $(w,h)$ is covariantly conserved if

$$\tag{19}  (\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\xi^{\mu}~\equiv~ (\partial_{\lambda}-h \Gamma_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\xi^{\mu}+\Gamma_{\lambda\nu}^{\mu}\xi^{\nu} ~=~0. $$

A co-vector density of weights $(w,h)$ is covariantly conserved if

$$\tag{20}(\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\eta_{\mu}~\equiv~  (\partial_{\lambda}-h \Gamma_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\eta_{\mu}-\Gamma_{\lambda\mu}^{\nu}\eta_{\nu} ~=~0. $$

In particular, if $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$ is a tensor density of weights $(w,h)$, then the covariant derivative $(\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$ is also a tensor density of weights $(w,h)$.

9599,Are mutliple database calls really significant with a network call for a web API?,"At one of my employers, we worked on a REST (but it also applies to SOAP) API. The client, which is the application UI, would make calls over the web (LAN in typical production deployments) to the API. The API would make calls to the database.

One theme that recurs in our discussions is performance: some people on the team believe that you should not have multiple database calls (usually reads) from a single API call because of performance; you should optimize them so that each API call has only (exactly) one database call.

But is that really important? Consider that the UI has to make a network call to the API; that's pretty big (order of magnitude of milliseconds). Databases are optimized to keep things in memory and execute reads very, very quickly (eg. SQL Server loads and keeps everything in RAM and consumes almost all your free RAM if it can).

TLDR: Is it really significant to worry about multiple database calls when we are already making a network call over the LAN? If so, why?

To be clear, I'm talking about order of magnitude -- I know that it depends on specifics (machine hardware, choice of API and DB, etc.) If I have a call that takes O(milliseconds), does optimizing for DB calls that take an order of magnitude less, actually matter? Or is there more to the problem than this?

Edit: for posterity, I think it's quite ridiculous to make claims that we need to improve performance by combining database calls under these circumstances -- especially with a lack of profiling.

I once observed a single webservice call be translated to about 500 database queries - this was hardly a problem when both the webservice and the database are located on the same machine, but turned into a response time of 6-7 seconds when they were on different machines.    

Obviously, 500 roundtrips to the database is pretty extreme. I'm not sure what your performance requirements are, but as a rule-of-thumb I would say that if you stay under around 10 database queries per REST-call you should not experience a significant performance hit.

4535,"Does the Canon *.CR2/CRW format contain ""truly RAW"" data?","In my work I am dealing with *.CR2 raw images taken by a Canon DSLR in raw mode.
When I read about the format here, I was surprised to find that it has 4 TIFF IFDs which contain a) Original Size JPEG Image b) Thumbnail JPEG image c) Uncompressed RGB data d) Lossless JPEG image.

My impression until now was any camera captured RAW image file would have Raw Bayer Data i.e. R,Gr,B,Gb kind of bayer data, and some EXIF data about camera capture settings etc.

But after reading this CR2 specification I am slightly confused as to how can it have a RGB data or even surprisingly JPEG data. This seems to be the data after demosaicing(obtaining the missing R/G/B pixel data for the original sensor Bayer pattern). If thats the case I would not consider *.CR2 as ""truly raw"" data. It has done demosaicing before dumping the socalled raw file.

Am I missing something?

Does any other Camera Raw formats(e.g. Nikon - *.NEF, Kodac - *.kdc, Pentax - *.ptx/pef,...) have real raw bayer data without any processing done?
",goldenmean,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/2438,"I think you are most definitely missing something. Consider: JPG is used to store (and usually compress, lossy) images. Any image. What is an image? It is a great big bundle of pixels, when all is said and done.

The output from the camera sensor is a great big bundle of pixels, too. They just happen not to be full-colour RGB pixels, they are monochrome pixels - whether any individual pixel represents R G or B depends on its location on the image sensor, which is known. But their monochrome, colour-given-by-position nature does not mean that they cannot be usefully stored in the JPG way. A bundle of pixels is a bundle of pixels, and why reinvent the wheel?

Look more closely at the document. ""So with a BAYER grid of RG/GB, the even rows has interleaved HuffCode/Diff data for ...RGRGRG..., while the odd rows it is ...GBGBGB..."". So, the raw Bayer output is stored in a JPG format. Lossless, it is stated (otherwise we'd have a problem!) and presumably in more than 8 bits' depth. You have too cook this quite a lot to get a useful photo from it. 

The other JPG images are used for in-camera preview, histogram and such. It makes good sense to cook these once and for all as the image is taken, rather than having to do it on the fly each and every time you want to look at them. This also means that the computer can fish these out for thumbnail purposes once you unload the camera into the PC.

* I can't add a comment for some reason, so this goes here:
Goldenmean, what makes you think that there is a problem that you don't have full RGB info for each pixel? Assuming that you are creating a RAW format and have a measurement of 128 from a ""red"" sensor cell; you can either choose to store this as 128,0,0 or 128,128,128 or, of you are feeling clever, 128,""data from next cell"", ""data from the cell after that"" to save some space. Doesn't matter really. It's the RAW converter's job to keep track of this (though I'm sure the programmers would appreciate it if you documented how you chose to store your sensor data) and make an actual picture from it.

2304,Why does playing the piano give me a pain in the neck?,"I have a keyboard set up with a proper stool so my arms are held straight out, with music at eye level - almost identical to how I set up my PC for good posture.

But while I can use the PC all day with no issues, within 5 minutes of playing the keyboard - I'm just starting - I get stiffness pain at the bottom of my neck, probably one vertebra above the shoulders.

Can anyone advise what is causing this and how to adjust? I think my main posture can't be too bad - I'm not hunching or craning my neck - but wondered if perhaps I am 'clenching' somehow?
",Mr. Boy,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/15313,"I'm a violinist, not a pianist, but it's very common for beginning violin players to have severe pain because they are too tense, especially when they are self taught.  I'm going to suggest a few generic techniques to start minimizing tension.


When you sit down at the piano, think about how you are sitting.
Look for any tension, especially in your neck and shoulders. Close
your eyes, and take a few deep, slow breaths to help you relax.
Play a note. Not a piece, or even a scale, just a single note.
Think about how relaxed you feel playing that note. Think about
tension in your back and shoulders. If you find any, slow down again
and relax. Now try two notes, or maybe even three or four. But still
think about relaxing, not about music. This is what your body should
feel like all the time when you play.
Now you've got a baseline for how you should feel while playing.
So play something simple. Either a short tune you know well, or a
scale, or whatever you find easy. Halfway through, stop and think
about tension. Did you tense up again? If you did, sit back, relax,
and start over, slower. Slowing down makes it easier to play, and
easier to think about not getting tense.
Another exercise is to practice breathing while playing. A lot of
beginners tend to hold their breathe, which just adds stress and
tension. So play a scale. Depending on your speed, you may want to
breathe in going up, and out going down, or breathe in for 4 notes,
out for 4 notes. Just practice breathing in rhythm, and being aware
of your breathe. When you are playing music, start thinking about
when you breathe in general. Breathing exercises aren't just for
singers.


In summary: Consciously relax before playing, and check for tension as you play. If you get tense, back off, relax, and slow down. Make sure you breathe.

If the tension is caused more by your posture, you may need to find a teacher to help you out, since we can't see how you hold yourself over the net. A teacher could also help with the sort of tension issues I'm talking about here, so if lessons are an option, it would probably be worthwhile, even if only for a short time.

6400,Are there any differences in how new vs. well-established professors select students?,"For any professors out there, do you feel that there are any differences in how you selected and recruited students from the time when you were newly hired, to a well-established stage (i.e. after getting tenure)? I'm asking this out of curiosity. There are oftentimes questions about whether students should choose a new/old advisor, but I haven't seen any that asked about this from the prof's perspective.

I would assume there are since the challenges and priorities for the two groups are normally somewhat different, but I'm not sure exactly how it would differ. For instance, it might be more difficult for the new PI to recruit students (especially good ones) when they have to ""compete"" with older, better funded peers. This would lead one to think that new PIs might be more likely to take on students they might not necessarily love, but just need bodies in the lab. However, on the other hand, new PIs are more likely to have limited funding, and if they are on the tenure-track, would need their few students to succeed in order to establish a name for themselves in the industry. In this case, it would be detrimental if they chose the wrong student(s) in the beginning, especially if they are limited to the number of students they can afford due to funding issues. I realize that this is field and situation specific, but I'm looking to hear stories/insights from people who have gone through/know about the process.

",Cornyvita,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/33881,"This will indeed  be highly  dependent on field. For instance,  in pure mathematics, there's a rather dramatic difference: most faculty don't take on any graduate students at all until after tenure.

The American Mathematical Society has written one of their culture statements about this issue. Generally, (pure) mathematicians have no labs and hence no need for bodies to fill them. And in math, on the time scale of a tenure clock, advising grad students is felt to have a net negative effect on research productivity (in the longer run there can be dividends). So the clear incentive is to wait until after tenure, and departments are usually fine with this.

If the intention is to get the rootweb then second is a better way of doing it as you are not instantiating a new SPSite object.

I apologize for slightly derailing the question, but I feel that Illustrator is a tool much better suited for web work than Photoshop—it's more maintainable and intuitive, once you've gotten past the initial unfamiliarity that comes from working with vector files instead of raster files.

3138,Photons and Relativity,"Consider a Photon from Sun and travels with a velocity $c$. Now think we are that photon. For us, it looks like Sun is moving away from us with a velocity $c$. So, why don't we get attracted back towards Sun, because the mass of Sun would be infinite for us since it moves away from us with a velocity $c$.
",Inquisitive,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/7527,"When anything moves at the speed of light, all of our physical models break down. If you were to watch a spaceship speed up to the speed of light, you would see a clock on the ship slow down and come to a complete stop when it hit the speed of light (assuming you could even see it at this point). The ship would also contract so much in the direction of motion that it would become infinitesimally small and, when it hit c, it's length would hit zero. As a result, matter cannot ever reach the speed of light (as far as we know).

It is a common misconception that mass changes when you travel at relativistic speeds, but this is not actually the case. The kinetic energy of an object increases relativistically, but the physical mass of the object (and, therefore it's gravitational effect on surrounding spacetime) does not actually change.

By our current notion of relativity, it is completely possible that there exists another universe within our own, in which photons are at rest and we are moving at 3e8 m/s and have energy but no other way of interacting with the type of ""matter"" that exists here. Our world is inaccessible to this one and vice-versa. There could be completely different laws of physics in this parallel universe, we have no idea because it exists (or doesn't) in a singularity.

Personally, i would most of the time go with forge first for +1 weapons against Zerg/Protoss and +1 armor against Terran and once the upgrade is started it's time for the Twilight Council followed by blink and +2.

However, getting Blink earlier allows you to play more aggressive, especially in PvP, so it's not a bad choice to go blink first.

The downside to this is that whenever I change the smart object, I need to repeat this process.

Is there a way to apply a smart object as a mask to a layer, and keep it as a smart object?
",JCBK,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/4089,"Yes, there's quite a few ways to achieve this.

If you want to paste objects from Illustrator as Smart Objects, then you can use is a a clipping mask for layers above. To clip a layer above the Smart Object, option-click between the layers. You should end up with something like this.



That's not how I'd do it though. The simpler option is just to have a vector mask on your bitmap layer (or vector layer, gradient, pattern or text). To do this, paste your path(s) from Illustrator as a Shape Object (very important!). You'll end up with something like this.



That's a shape layer in Photoshop CS6 (CS5 and earlier versions are similar).

If you'd like to use that path as a mask on another layer, select it using the Path Selection tool (A), then press command-C to copy it.

Then go to the bitmap layer you'd like to apply the vector mask to, and press command-V to paste.



Then choose Layer > Vector Mask > Current Path to use the path as the mask (this was slightly easier in CS5, as it could be all done by option-dragging the vector mask from one layer to another).

You'll end up with a bitmap layer with a vector mask.



Why is this better? It's one layer, not two. Your vector mask is still editable. You can also now clip other layers to this layer.

There's a lot of reasons why I don't like using Smart Objects. In most cases, Shape layers are better, unless you need the Smart Object to contain more than one colour or gradient itself, which is pretty rare for me.

There's a few other ways to mask, including using group masks. It really depends on what's important though.

You are arrested, prosecuted and sentenced but you are allowed to serve your sentence in your home country. As @MastaBaba pointed out, there are international agreements to organise this on a bilateral basis.
You are arrested, prosecuted, sentenced and you serve your sentence but it doesn't end there. You can still be deported and/or banned after the end of your sentence. Many European countries have actually introduced or strengthened legislation to this end in the last decade. So it's not either face trial or be deported, if you are really “lucky” it could be both!
You are arrested and criminal proceedings are initiated but you manage to come back home at some point during the procedure. In Europe, for a simple theft with no prior offence or aggravating circumstances, a jail sentence is unlikely and it is therefore unusual to be detained prior to trial. If you choose to “jump bail” and somehow manage to leave the country, things become a bit complicated. Among the possibilities:


The country where you committed your crime seeks your extradition to force you to appear in court and/or execute your sentence (not always possible because some countries never extradite their own citizens). For another prominent example, see Roman Polanski.
You are sentenced in absentia. Institutions like the Council of Europe have been pushing against this practice but some countries still do it. You might or might not be entitled to a retrial when you are finally caught but one effect is typically to suspend or extend statutes of limitation so that such a sentence means you will have to look over your shoulder and avoid going back to the country of your crime (or possibly all the countries that have an extradition treaty with that country) for the rest of your life.
You could still face prosecution in your home country (see below), although that would seem exceedingly unlikely for a theft.

Nothing happens, you come back home and are prosecuted in your country of origin. Many countries do that for particularly serious crimes but some countries also allow it for pretty much everything, in particular because they never extradite their own citizens. In the latter case, the crime in question must typically exist in the laws of both countries whereas in the former case, it's sometimes even possible to prosecute people for things that were not illegal where and when they happened (e.g. in many European countries, laws against child prostitution typically apply to offences committed abroad, without any reference to local law).
You are prosecuted in another, unrelated third country. It's unusual and typically limited to particularly heinous crimes (and in particular war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide) but it does happen. Among those that might take interest are your country or countries of residence or the country of origin or residence of any of your victims and Baltasar Garzón. See also Wikipedia.


Among other curiosities, the fact that it might sometimes be possible to be prosecuted in several places also raises questions related to the application of the non bis in idem principle.

In short, it depends a lot on the details, there is no overarching principle or international agreement that would apply in all cases.

8583,Modern design - What's that?,"I am working on redesigning my website and iterating through fivesecondtests. 

The overall feedback is improving but no matter what I change, several people have mentionned that my designs look ""dated"". ""Not modern"". ""Use modern fonts"". 


  What are ""modern fonts""? 
  Technically, Calibri, Cambria, etc. are ""modern fonts"", but I hardly ever see those online. What fonts are considered ""modern"" in the context of web design?
  
  What are the characteristics of a ""modern design""? Conversely what
  are the tell tale signs of a ""dated"" design?


For reference, here is the latest iteration of my design. Does it still look ""dated""? If so, what elements give that impression?





I think I am starting to get a better idea of what ""modern web design"" is:


No or light gradients
Sans serif typefaces
Light drop shadows
Good page hierarchy / directing visitor's attention


Is there anything else that makes a design look ""modern""? 

I have implemented the most of the recommendations in the answers, and I feel it has improved the design a lot. (Never mind the logo - will figure that one out later) 



Am I still stuck in the past? Or am I finally getting somewhere?



Implementing all recommendations, this is what I get:


It's obviously much better, but is it up to modern standards yet? If not, can it get there without changing massively the layout? 



The learning process never ends, does it? Assume that the central menu has a lava effect and that hopefully I can get a decent photo of myself shot to replace that one.



Looking at the various versions, I can see the design improving by leaps and bounds. Not sure how much further it needs to improve to reach professional standards, but it's certainly moving in the right direction.

Thanks a lot to all of you. I am impressed by the quality of the advice and how specific and actionable most recommendations have been so far.
",Sylverdrag,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/3392,"The third version is looking much better. Here's a few additional changes I would make.

Drop the little flying arrows and dotted rules in the background. They're just a distraction from in an increasingly focused layout.

Don't stretch the type in your buttons.

Make up your mind in the top half of the page. You still have two competing blocks of info. Here's what I would do:


Make ""Professional translation services"" the headline over the whole thing.
Move the bullet list to the left side.
Remove the ""Need translations?"" headline.
Shrink the box with the call center lady down to about the height of your bullet list (cut the padding about in half).
Put the buttons in the center of the page under all of that info.


With all that, I'd say you're ready for prime time. After you make your first $100k on this, go hire a UI designer to take it to the next level ;)

1437,"Maximal ideal in $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$","I am trying to prove that $(x,y)$ is a maximal ideal of $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$. Since an ideal $I \subseteq R$ is maximal if and only if $R/I$ is a field, it suffices to prove that $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/(x,y)$ is a field.
Let $\phi : \mathbb{Q}[x,y] \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ be the evaluation homomorphism that sends $p(x,y)$ to $p(0,0)$. $\phi$ is clearly surjective and if I prove that the kernel of $\phi$ is the ideal $(x,y)$, the result will follow by the First Isomorphism Theorem.    

$(x,y) \subseteq Ker(\phi)$ is obvious, but to prove the reverse inclusion, my idea is to take a polynomial $p(x,y) \in Ker(\phi)$ and to perform Euclidean division of $p(x,y)$ with $y$ and $x$ in $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$ and $(\mathbb{Q}[y])[x]$ respectively. The problem is that neither of them is a polynomial ring over field. There is a theorem saying that if R is commutative and if $R[x]$ is a PID, then $R$ is a field. Since neither $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, nor $\mathbb{Q}[y]$ are fields, it follows that neither $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$, nor $(\mathbb{Q}[y])[x]$ are PIDs, hence are not Euclidean domains.   

Obviously, Euclidean division does not solve the problem. If we consider $p(x,y)$ as an element in $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$ and if we divide by $y$, then we get a quotient $q(x,y)$ and a remainder which is $0$ or of degree $0$ over $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$, hence a polynomial $r(x)$ in $x$ only.    

Then, $p(x,y) = yq(x,y) + r(x)$ and the hypothesis $p(0,0)=0$ does not guarantee that $r(x)=0$. So, we cannot conclude that $y$ divides $p(x,y)$.

Is there a way to remedy this proof, or is there another approach to this problem?

8990,How can pKas differ across similar protons of the same atom?,"For example, citric acid has three acidic protons, all of which are carboxylic acids. Despite being part of the same functional groups, they all have very different pKas. Why (and how?) is this?
",peglegosaurus,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/13183,"Let's begin this discussion with the simpler oxalic acid.  

     O
     #
HO-C-C-OH
   #
   O


There are two carboxylic acid functional groups, and there are two different pKa's.  This is because double deprotonation does not happen simulateneously.  One gets deprotonated first, then the other.  After the first deprotonation, the residual molecule has a negative charge.  The result:

     O
     #
HO-C-C-O~
   #
   O


Is much less acidic because the presences of the carboxylate functional group changes the acidity.

Let's continue the discussion with the (still simpler) alpha-chlorosuccinic acid:

    Cl H O
     | | #
HO-C-C-C-C-OH
   # | |
   O H H


The acid closer to the chlorine is more acidic because the chlorine is strongly electron withdrawing, and 'pulls' the electrons out of the carboxylate function, which then 'pulls' electrons away from the hydrogen, making it more acidic.  This effect decreases with distance, so the chlorine pulls on the acid function farther away less strongly.

In a more generalized way, remote groups will modify acidity because of electron withdrawing or donating effects, but the farther away from the acid function, the less effect there is.

For citric acid, there are actually two different flavors of acid function, so one of the kinds will be intrinsically more acidic before deprotonation because of the remove effect.  However, because of the sequential deprotonation discussed above, all three will have different pKa's

328,Does this C++ static analysis rule make sense as is?,"I'm implementing some C++ static analysis rules, and one of them prohibits a function from returning a reference or pointer to a reference parameter of the function, i.e. the following are all non-compliant:

int *f(int&amp; x) { return &amp;x; } // #1
const int *g(const int&amp; x) { return &amp;x; } // #2
int&amp; h(int&amp; x) { return x; } // #3
const int&amp; m(const int&amp; x) { return x; } // #4


The justification given for this is that ""It is implementation-defined behaviour whether the reference parameter is a temporary object or a reference to the parameter.""

I'm puzzled by this, however, because stream operators in C++ are written in this way, e.g.

std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const X&amp; x) {
    //...
    return os;
}


I think I'm pretty confident that stream operators in C++ do not in general exhibit implementation-defined behaviour, so what's going on?

According to my understanding as it is at present, I would expect #1 and #3 to be well-defined, on the basis that temporaries cannot be bound to non-const references, so int&amp; x refers to a real object that has lifetime beyond the scope of the function, hence returning a pointer or reference to that object is fine. I would expect #2 to be dodgy, because a temporary could have been bound to const int&amp; x, in which case trying to take its address would seem a bad plan. I'm not sure about #4 - my gut feeling is that that's also potentially dodgy, but I'm not sure. In particular, I'm not clear on what would happen in the following case:

const int&amp; m(const int&amp; x) { return x; }
//...
const int&amp; r = m(23);

",Stuart Golodetz,https://stackoverflow.com/users/499449,"In C++11, #2 and #4 can be made safe if there are also rvalue reference overloads. Thus:

const int *get( const int &amp;x ) { return &amp;x; }
const int *get( const int &amp;&amp;x ) { return nullptr; }

void test() {
    const int x = 0;
    const int *p1 = get( x ); // OK; p1 is &amp;x.
    const int *p2 = get( x+42 ); // OK; p2 is nullptr.
}


So although they are dodgy, they do have safe uses if the programmer knows what they are doing. It'd be draconian to forbid this.

(Perhaps safer would be if the const rvalue reference overload was made private, left undefined, or otherwise caused a compile-time or link-time error. This is especially true for the #4 case, where we return a reference but there is nothing good to return a reference to and the language doesn't allow references to null.)

Obviously this depends on a multitude of factors, including the kinds of creatures in your deck, the kinds of non-creatures you have available, and the overall composition of the block you're drafting. Nonetheless, what's a good baseline for the number of creatures in a draft deck? And how should I decide if I need to run more or fewer creatures than the baseline?

Therefore I would consider the baseline types of spells for Limited not only creatures, but creatures + creature removals. Creatures with evasion are powerful in Limited, so sometimes the only solution to a sticky situation is a targeted removal.

So, assuming a 23-17 distribution, you want a total of 23 creatures and creature removals as the baseline.

Then you start replacing your worst creatures with, in this order:


Non-creature bombs (such as equipments, token generators), 
Direct Damage (might already count as removal depending on card and environment)
and finally, if you still have room, a little utility, such as mana fixing/acceleration, card drawing/searching, graveyard recycling, or cheap cantrips for thinning the deck.


You probably shouldn't go below ca. 15 creatures + removals in most cases. There is nothing worse than sitting on a hand and battlefield full of utility and equipments and getting beaten to death by a 2/2.

Lets assume i have project checked in svn trunk with this structure:

- Project-parent
- pom.xml
-- ModuleA
--- pom.xml (module A)
-- ModuleB
--- pom.xml (module B)


In my eclipse installation i have:

eclipse 3.7.2 64bit Java EE
subversive and svn connector for svn 1.6
m2e 1.1 from marketplace
m2e-subversive 0.13 (installed from alternative url)


My problem begins when i want to add new module to project. So i checkout project and modules by ""Import -> Check out Maven projects from SCM"". I create it with standard m2e 'Create new maven module' and after completing attributes my workspace looks like this:

- Project-parent (in trunk)
- pom.xml (in trunk)
-- ModuleA (in trunk)
--- pom.xml (in trunk)
-- ModuleB (in trunk)
--- pom.xml (in trunk)
-- ModuleC
--- pom.xml


Project builds with ""mvn clean install"". So I want to check it ModuleC in into svn but there is no option with functionality ""Share module into svn"".

Finally my questions:


How do you check in your new modules into existing repository? Is it through eclipse 'Share project' or external tool like Tortoise?
If its through Eclipse, do you automatically have 'connection' between module project and svn (by connection i mean annotation on project about svn url and current revision)
When you have 'connection' in your case, can you chage something in commited ModuleC and see 'dirty' svn marker on Project-parent?
How to achieve such connection manually? The only way i could do it is through deleting all projects and again performing ""Check out Maven projects from SCM"" and picking all projects again.
When you create submodule sceleton in different location than workspace and then check it into svn, how to import it back to workspace and to m2e from svn?

",ljader,https://stackoverflow.com/users/498096,"You must also mount the main project in eclipse, the parent of the module. Then, use this project to check in the new module as you are doing for any change set. This project is only used for SVN synchronization purpose. For your developments, use the module projects.

For your last question, this is a maven constraint to have its sub module below the parent project. You won't be able (at least not easily) to create a module somewhere, check it in below the parent and then checkout the whole project with the new module.

Try to keep it simple. 

Use the parent project when you want to synchronize new modules.

860,Reading own metadata within a Qt plugin class,"I am currently writing my own Qt plugin to be used in a Qt program. To identify the plugin version information, I use the metadata as stored in the JSON file like the following:

{
    ""type"" :            ""communication"",
    ""name"" :            ""USB-LIN-IB"",
    ""longname"" :        ""USB-LIN Communication"",
    ""version"" :         ""1.1"",
    ""dependencies"" :    []
}


To access these metadata information from outside the plugin classes (within the Qt program world), I fall back on them as I have defined the JSON file like this:

Q_PLUGIN_METADATA(IID ""org.plugins.communications.1"" FILE ""USBLINCommunication.json"")


Is it possible to use a standardized and convenient way to access exactly the same metadata from within the plugin member (e.g. the plugin constructor)?
Of course, I could either use the QPluginLoader (for which I have to know the plugin file path) or a file readAll from a JSON Object. However, both methods rely on knowing the exact path of the plugin and the JSON file. This is not very reliable for me. 

I thought there is another more standardized way?
",Hokyo,https://stackoverflow.com/users/873072,"You do not need to know the absolute plugin file path for QPluginLoader, so you would be safe.

You can just pass the plugin name, and it will work fine. It will also return the fully-qualified file name of the plugin, including the full path to the plugin if you are reading the file name back with the corresponding method. It will be clear for the class based on the information that can be obtained from QCoreApplication::libraryPaths().

Here is the corresponding part of the documentation:


  When loading the plugin, QPluginLoader searches in the current directory and in all plugin locations specified by QCoreApplication::libraryPaths(), unless the file name has an absolute path. After loading the plugin successfully, fileName() returns the fully-qualified file name of the plugin, including the full path to the plugin if one was given in the constructor or passed to setFileName().


Therefore, what you could do basically is this:

myPluginLoader.metaData().value(""MetaData"").toObject().value(""foo"").toString()


where foo can be either of your aforementioned keys.

2894,Moving a WP Multisite to a subdirectory,"Firstly, I've read a number of posts on this process. However, for various reasons, the process remains difficult to implement or troubleshoot for lack of even abstracted examples, or maybe too abstracted. And there's a few ""can not do"" posts, nearly always followed up by ""with 3.5, you now can"" caveats, so whether one can remains ambiguous, though no doubt non-trivial.

Summary:

How to move a wordpress multisite (WPMS) from root.com to root/blogs?

For this example, we're moving a WPMS from ""root.com"" to ""root.com/blogs""

I understand that I need to update the paths in the database and wp-config.php appropriately. It seems I may also have to update .htaccess? I'm also aware of the serialization issue with search/replace and mysql query updates.

I have a WPMS that I've updated to 3.5. I've found the following tables with domain and path info

Existing working configuration before move to subdirectory

1. wp_blogs

select blog_id, domain, path from wp_blogs;
+---------+-------------+--------+
| blog_id | domain      | path   |
+---------+-------------+--------+
|       1 | root.com    | /      |
|       2 | root.com    | /matt/ |
+---------+-------------+--------+


2. wp_site

select * in wp_site;
+----+-------------+------+
| id | domain      | path |
+----+-------------+------+
|  1 | root.com    | /    |
+----+-------------+------+


3. The blog_id corresponds to the wp_#_options tables which contain:

select option_name,option_value from wp_2_options 
where option_name = 'home' or option_name = 'siteurl';
+-------------+--------------------------+
| option_name | option_value             |
+-------------+--------------------------+
| home        | http://root.com/matt/    |
| siteurl     | http://root.com/matt/    |
+-------------+--------------------------+


4. In my wp-config.php I have the following WPMS-specific lines:

define('WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true);
define( 'MULTISITE', true );
define( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', false);
$base = '/';
define( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'root.com' );
define( 'PATH_CURRENT_SITE', '/' );
define( 'SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );
define( 'BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );


5. Lastly, in my .htaccess, I have:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]

# uploaded files
RewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?files/(.+) wp-includes/ms-files.php?file=$2 [L]

# add a trailing slash to /wp-admin
RewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?wp-admin$ $1wp-admin/ [R=301,L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^ - [L]
RewriteRule  ^[_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/(wp-(content|admin|includes).*) $1 [L]
RewriteRule  ^[_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/(.*\.php)$ $1 [L]
RewriteRule . index.php [L]


Updates required to move the site

It seems to me that in order to move my site to the /blogs , I would:

1. Update wp_blogs to

mysql&gt; update wp_blogs set domain=concat(domain, '/blogs'), path=concat(path, 'blogs/');
select blog_id, domain, path from wp_blogs where blog_id &lt; 3;
+---------+-------------+--------------+
| blog_id | domain      | path         |
+---------+-------------+--------------+
|       1 | root.com    | /blogs/      |
|       2 | root.com    | /blogs/matt/ |
+---------+-------------+--------------+


2. Update wp_site to

update wp_site set domain=concat(domain, '/blogs'), path=concat(path, 'blogs/');
select * from  wp_site;
+----+-------------+------------+
| id | domain      | path       |
+----+-------------+------------+
|  1 | root.com    | /blogs/    |
+----+-------------+------------+


3. wp_#_options

+-------------+--------------------------------+
| option_name | option_value                   |
+-------------+--------------------------------+
| home        | http://root.com/blogs/matt/    |
| siteurl     | http://root.com/blogs/matt/    |
+-------------+--------------------------------+


4. wp_config.php

define('WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true);
define( 'MULTISITE', true );
define( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', false);
$base = '/blogs/';
define( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'root.com' );
define( 'PATH_CURRENT_SITE', '/blogs/' );
define( 'SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );
define( 'BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );


note: I'm not clear how this step is appropriately updated

5. .htaccess

I found vague ""update .htaccess appropriately"" instructions, but not specifics. Update RewriteBase? Which lines in .htaccess to I update when I move root.com to root.com/blogs?

Missing from the above process will be the paths founds in posts. My druthers are to use the search and replace tool for that, after I've made this more fundamental updates; or am I wrong?

Update bungeshea suggests that, yes, I point RewriteBase to the ""blogs"" subdirectory, i.e.,

RewriteBase /Blogs

4127,House rules to make the cloister less of a game winning tile in Carcassonne?,"In my experience, cloister tiles in Carcassonne are often ""too lucky"". If you draw a cloister tile in the beginning of the game, it will typically still require an investment of quite a bit of ""meeple"" time to obtain the full 9 points, which makes it a fair trade-off. However, after about half of the game, it's relatively likely that you can ""parachute"" a cloister tile in some spot and get 8 or 9 points immediately. This adds a lot of randomness to the game.

What house rules work well to diminish this effect?
",Erik P.,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/30,"I don't have bad experiences with cloisters. But if they count too heavy, you can rule that an unfinished cloister counts as 0 points in the end. Which makes it harder to spend too much meeple on them.

Another possible rule is that cloisters must have unique 9 squares, not shared with another cloister.

But use them wise.

however, consider two rings, both commutative rings with unity.  is it possible that one ring contains zero divisors and one does not while there exists an ring homomorphism between the two?
there could not be a isomorphism between the two rings because there would be no one to one or onto mapping between the two rings. but could there be an operation preserving mapping between an integral domain and a commutative ring with unity and with zero divisors? 
clearly if such a mapping did exists it would not seem to be one to one or onto, but does this rule out the potential of a homomorphism existing between the two?
",user74091,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/74091,"Consider the map

where $k$ is a field. This is the inclusion of $k$ into a quotient of the polynomial ring over $k$ in two variables. We see that this is a ring homomorphism, as $$\phi(ab) = (ab + (XY)) = (a + (XY))(b + (XY)) = \phi(a)\phi(b).$$ So we have an injection of a field (not just an integral domain, and not just a homomorphism) into a commutative ring with zero divisors: $$(X + (XY))(Y + (XY)) = XY + (XY) = 0 + (XY) = (XY).$$
Like xyzzyx said in his answer, you can also find a surjective map from an integral domain to a commutative ring with zero divisors (eg. $\pi : \Bbb{Z}\twoheadrightarrow\Bbb{Z}/n\Bbb{Z}$, where $n$ is composite), so we can indeed find injective or surjective maps from an integral domain to a ring with zero divisors.

6805,How to remember 10 last read articles with timestamp in session for a user in Codeigniter?,"I would like to make a PHP if condition code that will check if the last 10 articles or 10 minutes from the article reading by the user have already elapsed.

E.g. 

A user open a page with id = 235 (this id value is in the url localhost/article/235 )

and this id value will be saved in session with a current timestamp and maybe his IP address

Then he read another article and the same will happen.

I need to remember the clicked stuff for another ten clicks and then reset that only for the first row. E.g. after the 10th click the id and timestamp will not became 11th row but will replace the 1st row in the list.

The php condition in CodeIgniter will then check these values and will update the article hit counter value in the articles table and column counter like this:   

   $this-&gt;db-&gt;where('id', $id);
   $this-&gt;db-&gt;set('counter', 'counter+1', FALSE);
   $this-&gt;db-&gt;update('articles');


But before calling this code I need to make this check from the session?

How to do that?

I think storing e.g. 10 entries in the session with timestamps per user will be enough.

Just don't save the same page in the session twice.

And the condition will check the current timestamp with the saved one and if it is more than e.g. 10 minutes or the user have read/clicked another 10 articles it will allow the update counter php code.

I don't need to have this bulletproof. Just to disable the increment using browser's refresh button. 

So, if he wants to increment the counter he will need to wait ten minutes or read another 10 articles ;)

As you can see, the bottom-right point of the diamond is perfectly on the path, but the top-left point is clearly above the path.  It appears that the diamond lies on the tangent line of the path at the bottom-right point of the diamond.

Question:

How can I place this open diamond arrow tip so that both points of the diamond are on the path?

Bonus Question:

What is the best solution to make the area inside the diamond completely white? I don't want to see the path in the inside of the diamond.  I currently have a solution that I feel is a hack, which is to place a white (closed) diamond arrow tip in the same spot first:

mark=at position .5 with {\arrow[&gt;=diamond, white] {&gt;} },

I have edited the code for a slightly better placement however it is still not perfectly following the curvature, this is due to the size of the diamond shape compared to the curvature in the markings library and I don't see a direct fix other than drawing to an intermediate diamond node and then drawing to the final point.

4436,How do I chose a good camera for texture hunting?,"Texture hunting is the photography of walls, surfaces, artefacts, etc, typically outdoors, with the intention of using the photos in a computer game.  The photo could be of a brick or concrete wall, a chain link face, a door / window, or whatever.  It is also possible to photograph a white wall that has been damaged or stained in some way, process it in various ways, and use this as a mask on top of other textures, in order to get a new damaged variant.

Textures are typically lighting-neutral and extremely sharp.  The computer game will compute its own lighting and shadows.  One must avoid having a shadow across the subject, as this will only have to be removed in post-processing.  Typically, texture hunting is done on cloudy days where there is a uniform soft light from the sky.

1024×1024 is a reasonable size of the final texture, but it's usually photographed at a higher res, photoshopped considerably, and then sized down.  The subject of the photo could be something like 5 metres × 5 metres.  The idea is that every pixel is being used to the fullest effect to convey the character of the surface.  Textures are often photoshopped to become seamless so they can be repeated across a large surface in game.

Textures are usually shot perpendicular to the wall as much as possible, otherwise distortion correction is required.  Sometimes you can take a photo from further away and zoom in to get a better view of a high wall.

It is often quite hard to find a surface in the real world that has an interesting texture and is easy to photograph from the right angle.  In particular, taking photos of the floor is challenging because you need to be several metres above it, looking down.  Leaning out of windows / over bridges, or holding up a tripod are solutions.

One thing that concerns me is that some cameras do image processing on the digital image.  Really, the artist has to be doing all of the image processing offline, in photoshop or similar.  I often see digital camera photos with edge enhancement artefacts in high contrast areas.  Perhaps raw shooting mode is the answer to this?

Shooting digital photos with greater colour depth than ""8 bit per channel"" might also be useful to avoid banding when increasing contrast during post-processing.

Another thing is lens distortion — since we need to photograph flat surfaces.  Either the camera has to be good at it, or it should be possible to turn it off so the processing can be done manually by an artist.

How do I find a camera which meets these requirements?
",Spark,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/6311,"While the camera and lens are obviously going to have an impact on your success, I have to think that a good solid grasp on lighting techniques is going to have more impact on shooting textures than the camera will.

Just about any current DSLR (or even high-end P&amp;S), ideally with a low-distortion prime lens, should give you plenty of technology to get started.  The full-frame suggestion is absolutely right for optimum results, and certainly gives the advantage of a ton of resolution that you can crop to size, but it's going to be fairly expensive.  If money is no object, go for the full-frame camera, but if you're on a budget, get a more modest camera and save some money for lighting equipment -- I think you'll produce better results with an entry-level DSLR and great lighting than you will with a full-frame camera and no lighting equipment.

If you're not familiar with the sort of impact lighting can have on your photos, check out strobist.com or some of the other communities that specialize in lighting techniques.  I think you'll start to see how lighting is going to make the highlights and shadows in your textures really pop.

4490,Java ServiceLoader with multiple Classloaders,"What are the best practices for using ServiceLoader in an Environment with multiple ClassLoaders? The documentation recommends to create and save a single service instance at initialization:

private static ServiceLoader&lt;CodecSet&gt; codecSetLoader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecSet.class);


This would initialize the ServiceLoader using the current context classloader. Now suppose this snippet is contained in a class loaded using a shared classloader in a web container and multiple web applications want to define their own service implementations. These would not get picked up in the above code, it might even be possible that the loader gets initialized using the first webapps context classloader and provide the wrong implementation to other users.

Always creating a new ServiceLoader seems wasteful performance wise since it has to enumerate and parse service files each time. Edit: This can even be a big performance problem as shown in this answer regarding java's XPath implementation.

How do other libraries handle this? Do they cache the implementations per classloader, do they reparse their configuration everytime or do they simply ignore this problem and only work for one classloader?

2218,Double weapons and switching hands,"I am playing a Warblade weilding a Spiked Chain.

I have one head of the chain enchanted with +1 Sweeping, and the other head with +2.

My question is, if I have the +2 end as my main attack, and the +1 as offhand, can I still choose to make a Trip attack with the +1 end anytime I choose?
How easy is it to switch the ends of a double weapon?
",EisenKreutzer,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/11719,"tl;dr: Yes, you may attack freely with either end of a double weapon, except when using Two-Weapon Fighting, where the offhand attack cannot be made with the same end as the main attack.

You may use any weapon you are wielding for any attack. You may choose which wielded weapon you use independently of the choice you made for any previous attacks; that is, you are never &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; to any particular weapon (or &ldquo;locked out&rdquo; for that matter, with one major exception explained below).

Choosing a weapon for an attack is not even a free action; it is a non-action component of the attack itself. There is not actually any point where you &ldquo;change&rdquo; which weapon you are using; each attack simply lets you choose a weapon, independently of any prior attacks you may have made.

Thus you may use a different weapon for each attack, or the same weapon over and over, or whatever. For double weapons, this means that both ends are available for any given attack. It does not matter if the previous attack was in the last round, or was an attack of opportunity just before your turn, or was a previous attack in a full-attack: the weapon you choose to use for this attack is completely independent of the weapon you chose to use for any previous attacks.

Note that choosing to use different weapons for each attack in a full-attack does not constitute using Two-Weapon Fighting. If you have multiple attacks for iteratives, haste, or whatever else, you may choose the weapon you use for each attack independently, and you take no penalty for choosing a different weapon than the last attack. You only take a penalty when you explicitly use Two-Weapon Fighting to get a bonus attack. This bonus attack is also the aforementioned big exception.

Big Exception: Two-Weapon Fighting

There is one major exception to the general case where you may use any wielded weapon: Two-Weapon Fighting (or Multiweapon Fighting). These combat options give a bonus attack, known as an offhand attack, but this offhand attack must be made with a different weapon than the main attack that it is paired with (and in the case of Multiweapon Fighting, a weapon different from any prior offhand attacks in the same set).

In other words, you are not free to choose a weapon you have already used when taking the bonus attacks offered by Two-Weapon or Multiweapon Fighting.

Double weapons explain that, as a special exception to the Two-Weapon Fighting rules, you may use the same double weapon for both attacks when using Two-Weapon Fighting, but they must be made with separate ends of the double weapon, and you take attack penalties as if you were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.

This is the only time where one end of the double weapon would not be available as an option for an attack: if you used an end as the main attack when Two-Weapon Fighting, the bonus attack must be made with the other end.

Also, note that you do not &ldquo;have&rdquo; one end as main and the other as offhand. The terms main and offhand are not used, and have no meaning, except during Two-Weapon Fighting. If you are not using Two-Weapon Fighting, it&rsquo;s just an attack, not main or offhand or anything else. Two-Weapon Fighting and the main/offhand designations apply only during the full-attack in which you use Two-Weapon Fighting; as soon as that full-attack completes, both ends become equal again (including for attacks of opportunity during that round).

All you need to type by hand is the GET / HTTP/1.0 and Host: google.com lines. Then hit enter twice. This way you really see the full response from the remote HTTP server, with nothing getting in the way. As you play around with it you learn better how HTTP works, and will never get confused when redirects are happening (as you can see is happening above, via the 301 HTTP status and Location header), and your tool (browser, wget, curl) is handling them automatically for you.

Edit: how to pass GET parameters using telnet. Just add them to the path you're GETting when you speak HTTP:

$ telnet thewebsite.co.uk 80

The RB3 Keyboard is not a full-sized keyboard.  If we do use a full-sized midi keyboard in Pro mode, can we/do we have to use the entire keyboard, as it's played in the actual song, or can we/do we have to stick to two octaves (like the RB3 Keyboard)?
The RB3 Keyboard can also function as a five-button peripheral in non-Pro mode.  Can we do the same with a normal midi keyboard?
I've read that the RB3 keyboard has velocity-sensitive keys.  Does RB3 take this into effect?  Will I lose some functionality if my midi keyboard isn't velocity-sensitive?  Does the expressions bar also add functionality?

",BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/2578,"My qualifications: I've used both the RB3 keyboard and a Roland D-50 MIDI Synth with a MIDI adapter.


If you use a full-sized midi keyboard in Pro mode, you do NOT use the entire keyboard. RB3 ignores notes played outside the two octave range of the RB3 keyboard. The pro keys chart displayed is the same no matter what kind of keyboard you are using (unlike the pro guitar charts which I understand are different depending on whether you use a 17-fret Mustang or a 22-fret Squier).
A normal midi keyboard can also function as a five-button peripheral in non-Pro mode. The only thing missing are the color-coded tags over the C-D-E-F-G keys that the RB3 keyboard has, but since you shouldn't be looking at your hands anyway, that shouldn't matter ;)
I don't think RB3 does anything with the velocity-sensitive keys, so you should not lose any functionality if your midi keyboard isn't velocity-sensitive. This is the only answer I'm not 100% positive on (my D-50 has velocity-sensitive keys), but I'm pretty sure.
The expression bar on the RB3 keyboard is like the whammy bar on the 5-button guitar controllers - it alters the sound of the notes and when used on a held note with overdrive, it will add to your overdrive bar. My D-50 has a pitch bend joystick that the MIDI adapter converts to the same function.

1036,bash script to sort out duplicates in text file,"I converted all the flac in my music library down to mp3, so I can move the flac to an external drive. I used dbpoweramp in windows, and I'm pretty sure it converted them all, but when I woke up this morning, the netbook had been restarted.

So I've made a list with all my music in it and used sort to alphabetize it. So I have something like this:

~/music/a/a.flac
~/music/a/a.mp3
~/music/a/b.flac
~/music/a/b.mp3
~/music/b/a.mp3
~/music/b/b.mp3
~/music/c/a.flac
~/music/c/a.mp3


Note that I have a directory with only mp3, since not my whole library was flac.

What I want is a bash script that will check that all lines that end with .flac have a line directly below them that is the same except it ends with .mp3.

How would I achieve this, and if you can explain what the script is doing, that would be cool too.

I guess it's sorta important to show any lines that end with .flac that DON'T have a matching .mp3, as they need converted still.
",Rob,https://superuser.com/users/97687,"awk '

        line = NR
        next
    }
    { root = """" }
' filename


How does it work? 

Starting with the line beginning /.flac$/, foreach line ending with "".flac"", create a variable named root containing the line minus the extension. Saves the current line number. Jump to the next line to avoid erasing the root variable just set.

Going to the first line. This expression root &amp;&amp; $0 != root "".mp3"" means: root is non-empty AND the current line ($0) is not equal to the value of the root variable plus "".mp3"". If this expression evaluates to true, then the current line is not the MP3 file corresponding with the previous FLAC file.

The last line erases the value of the root variable. This part of script is reached only if the current line is not a FLAC file, so we don't want to make the comparison with the next line.

If you look for Cold Iron on Wikipedia, you only get iron: 
""Cold iron is a poetic and archaic term for iron.""
This would imply everything made mostly from Fe is cold iron. Clearly, this is not the case, in every game Cold Iron is something special, the every day sword is not made out of it. 

The Dresden Files rulebook is not very specific about it:


  something that anyone could reasonably get access to, but usually doesn’t carry on them (like cold iron) page 185.


What is cold iron?
How do I create cold iron?
How do I get cold iron?   

To make the question easier to understand, compare Cold Iron to Holy Water. You know how it is different from usual Water, you know how you get it or create it. 
",András,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/9552,"In the Dresden Files books, Cold Iron is just Iron, and things made mostly of Iron count as Cold Iron.

Steel is an alloy made out of Iron and Carbon. So I did some research as to how much of steel is actually iron and I found that the carbon content of steel is between 0.002% and 2.1% by weight. Essentially, anything that is made out of steel is somewhere around 98%-99% iron and in my opinion counts as Cold Iron for game purposes. This is why the ""Cold Iron"" catch is +2 or +3 (depending on the amount of powers connected to the Catch), because ""Cold Iron"" is pretty plentiful. Basically just about any sword or knife made from methods as far back as archaic blacksmithing up to and including modern manufacturing will count for satisfying the Cold Iron Catch.

I suppose you could run into an issue with Stainless Steel as it contains 10% chromium, but I'd personally rule that Stainless Steel which is around 88% iron would still work for satisfying the Catch.

7065,How best can I discover what is up with my electrical bill?,"This might be subjective, I don't know. However, it's a serious problem for me. My electrical bill is outrageous. It's three times as large as my next-door neighbor, and four or five times the size of my neighbor's across the street. It's worse in the summer (I live in central TX), but I've had the air conditioner inspected, and while the house is right at the maximum capacity for our unit, the unit should still be able to take care of the load. That also doesn't explain why our winter bills are larger than the comparables.

What I would like to do is check the amount of current drawn by each running appliance and calculate where all my money is going. I just don't know how to go about doing this.
",moswald,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/168,"One thing not addressed in your question is how many kW-hrs you are using compared to your neighbors. You can't just compare on dollars. In TX with the deregulated electrical industry, you could very easily be paying 2-3 times what your neighbors are paying per kW if you haven't checked it recently. Last summer I switched companies to get from ~$0.19 to $0.092, while keeping the 100% renewable energy sources that I had before.

1306,Different tyre width (front and back),"Out of necessity, I had to put an 1.26"" (32mm) rear tyre on my bike where the front tyre is only 1.1"" (28mm) wide (and the bike came with 1.1"" tyres when I bought it). Are there any advantages or disadvantages of this, shall I try to get an 1.1"" tyre for the rear wheel ASAP or is it safe this way?
",Tamás,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/482,"Riding with a larger tire in the front provides certain advantages. I do this for two reasons:


Less slipping and sliding in the snow: With a bigger tire in the front you get more friction with the ground. This is important because your front tire is a lot more likley to flip you over then your rear because your rear tire has more weight on it.
Vertical cracks: The reason I keep a larger tire on now that it is warmer is to avoid falling due to vertical cracks and my tire getting stuck in them. Basically if your tire can't fit in the crack you can't get stuck in it and flip over.

2255,How to proceed when you are coordinating a project among several research groups and they do not contribute to the progress of the project,"I am principal investigator in some project that involves other research groups from other countries. When I was writing the proposal, I asked them if they would like to joint the project, and they agreed. I wrote everything, all paperwork, etc. Now, 6 months after the project has been officially started, they are not contributing in any way to the project, only attending project meetings where they talk about their universities, but nothing about the project. I am really annoyed because the situation. From my point of view they should get involved, as my group does. Before asking them directly for the last time in probably in an unpolite way if they will do their assigned part, how would you proceed here?
",flow,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/284,"The path to proceed likely depends strongly on four factors:


Does the project have clear and specific milestones in the contract that the collaborators are failing to meet?
Are the others subcontractors to your institution or independently contracted?
What type of oversight is being exerted by the funding agency, and how is the relationship with the responsible program manager?
Are you willing to burn a bridge?


Typically, as lead PI you are responsible for the execution of the entire project, not just your portion, and therefore have a responsibility to your funding agency to appropriately manage your subcontracting collaborators.  If the funding agency has instead decided to execute independent contracts to each of the PIs in the grant, then it is largely out of your hands and there is little that you can (or should) do.

Assuming you are lead PI, then if the contract (not the proposal) has requirements in its statement of work that they are not meeting by the given milestone deadlines, then you have much more leverage and a clear case for a ""shape up or get defunded"" conversation.  Similarly, if the funding agency is exerting strong oversight (e.g., in the USA, DARPA often threatens de-funding unless you meet strong milestones by particular frequent deadlines or regularly outperform other research teams; NSF has a much looser oversight process that often just wants to see that something interesting is being accomplished) then you have a strong case that their failure to perform is directly imperiling the whole research project.  In either case, as lead PI you have both the right and the responsibility to cancel their funding and redirect it to better accomplish the research tasks that you are being held accountable for.  

If the contract doesn't have accountable goals and you aren't being held accountable for their behavior, however, then it is more just a moral offense to you, and you have much less basis on which to legitimately defund your colleagues.  Instead, you might look at it as a lesson for the future on writing more specific contracts that can give you the leverage you need to deal with non-performers.

Now if you do defund your colleagues, this has a high likelihood of burning bridges.  If you didn't trust them to shape up, why would you want to work with them again?  If they feel you defunded them unfairly, why would they want to work with you again?
If the mandate comes from the funding agency program manager rather than you, that may make the defunding somewhat more acceptable by making it ""not your fault,"" but your colleagues may still see it that way.  Thus, if the relationship is more important than the money being lost, you may then want to just write this off as a lesson learned and plan more carefully for the future.

In short: there are no easy paths, but which one to walk depends on the balance of relationship value vs. accountability in your contract with your funder and your colleagues.

I think the custom power/exponent methods are a probably waste of time when Math.pow and Math.exp would do just as well in this context.
The X/Y passes can be identical except the direction the bell curve is applied in. I'm assuming the extra passes are to handle the edges, but I think you might come out ahead by just doing 2 passes and perform clipping as you go.
I think I see some bit-hacking tricks to avoid some divides after going through the inner multiplication loops. I'm not convinced that doing this and going through all the averaging stuff is going to be faster than just doing two simple passes using multiples in the inner loop and 3 integer divides when the loop is complete.
Some multiplies can also be eliminated when writing to the temp array by making another array containing the offsets for each row. Like this:

temp = new int[w * h];  
row = new int[h];

// make row offsets  
for(int i = 0; i &lt; h; i++)  
    row[i] = w * i;  

// write a pixel  
temp[x + row[y]] = color;  

// read a pixel  
color = temp[x + row[y]];  

Try to avoid calling methods within the X loops, they probably have a bigger overhead than you want for this.

4453,Manually adding 's' to 'http',"I did a Wireshark capture of my login into a drupal-based website. The website does not use https. And so, quite obviously, I was able to capture my username and password in plain text by simply  using the http.request.method==POST filter in Wireshark. 

Then, I tried to access the same web page by manually adding a s to http in the url. Quite naturally, my browser showed this:



Then I went ahead and did my login again, and did the Wireshark capture again. 

To my surprise, I do not have the any captures corresponding to the http.request.method==POST filter. 

So, my questions:


When I am not really using https, why wasn't I able to capture login id and password in plain text?
What effect did manually adding s to http have?

",pnp,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/9778,"Despite what you may think, you actually were using HTTPS.  This is perhaps an over-simplification, but here's more or less what happened:

When you accessed the website with http:// as the protocol in your Address Bar, you effectively told your computer ""Make a request for this webpage, from this server, and send that request to port 80 on the server"".  If the server is configured to allow access via plain HTTP (apparently, it was), the server will respond and your session (unless re-directed) will continue over HTTP.

By changing the protocol to https://, you instead directed your computer to attempt an SSL/TLS handshake via port 443 on the server and then send the HTTP requests through that tunnel.  Obviously, this worked or you would not have been able to access the page.  Since the SSL/TLS connection was successful, that meant that all subsequent HTTP requests sent through that tunnel would be secured from casual eavesdropping (e.g.: via Wireshark).

But now, you ask, what about that nasty red slash through https, and the ""x"" on the lock?  These indicators do not mean that the SSL/TLS connection was unsuccessful, or that your communications to the website are not encrypted.  All these negative indicators mean is that the website is not signed by an authority your browser recognizes.  This is often the case for the web interfaces on SOHO networked equipment, business applications, or websites where the administrator has chosen to use a self-signed certificate instead of purchasing one from a well-recognized authority (e.g.: VeriSign).

This is analogous in some ways to selling alcohol in a jurisdiction where such sales are age-restricted.  Since I don't know all the intricacies of the real-world laws, let's say for the sake of argument that the law only goes so far as to say it is illegal to sell alcohol to a person who is younger than a given age.  What the law in this hypothetical case does not specify is whether you are required to check I.D. prior to a sale, or which forms of I.D. are considered to be valid proofs of age at time of sale.  Authoritative proof of the buyer's age is only ultimately required in court if the legality of the sale is ever challenged.  However, it is still of course a good idea to check I.D.s on every sale just to be safe.

Here, you are a clerk at a convenience store in the great state of Comodo.  Most of your customers will be fellow Comodoans, and so you are naturally able to easily recognize and verify their I.D.s which are issued by the Comodo Government.

One day though, you get a customer from the distant state of VeriSign.  What do you do now?  Fortunately, your store has a book called Trusted Root Certificates which has pictures and tips on how to verify I.D.s issued from various states in your country.  You check your book, compare the customer's I.D. to the relevant photograph and notes, and judge that the I.D. is indeed issued by an authority trusted by your store.  Given this, you can now trust that the information on the I.D. (particularly, stating the customers identity and age) is accurate, and therefore be comfortable in knowing that you are making a legal sale.

On another day, a customer comes in from overseas.  His name is Drupal, and he hails from the land of DigiNotar.  He says he is old enough to buy alcohol, and his DigiNotarian Government I.D. concurs with his statement.  However, your Trusted Root Certificates book does not have any information to help you verify an I.D. from his country.  What do you do here?

Strictly speaking, by the letter of the law in this hypothetical country, your sale would still be legal if your customer is in fact as old as he says he is.  You could choose to assume he is telling the truth and, if he actually is, go on with your life without ever being convicted of any crime related to that action.

But, without any documentation from an authority you recognize, you are still taking the risk that he is not telling the truth.  It's very possible that he is not of the proper age, despite what he and his I.D. may claim.  In this case, the sale will still be completed.  The product will still only be transferred between you and your customer (not immediately available to anyone else, unless your customer chooses to distribute it), but now the problem is that the alcohol has been given to someone who legally should not have it - and you could be in trouble for this.



TL;DR:  As long as your browser shows https:// as the protocol, you can be assured that the data in your communications are secured between your computer and some endpoint.  If there's any warning signs around that https:// area though, that means that the browser does not trust that endpoint to be what it claims to be.  It is then up to you to decide whether you trust the endpoint's claims to identity enough to transfer sensitive data over the connection.  The connection is still secure in the sense that nobody between you and the other end of the HTTPS connection can sniff the data, but you are taking the chance that the other end isn't what it claims to be.

4209,Looking up for an item in a list and different table styles in iOS,"I have a settings view with a grouped table. One of the cells of such table is intended to show a very long list of items from where I want the user to select one. Due to the length of the list, I need to provide a way to make easier to find a certain item.

One of the options I think there are, is to show letters of alphabet as indexes at the right side of a plain table. Since my first table is a grouped one, my navigation hierarchy would be then like this:

  

Would it be inconsistent to navigate from a grouped table to a plain table? If so, could somebody give an existing example? I didn't find anything related to this in iOS Human Interface Guidelines, maybe it is described somewhere else and this navigation pattern breaks the guidelines.

Another option could be having a search bar. Can a search bar be used in both a plain table and a grouped table? The existing example of such bar I found is in Contacts app and it is a plain table. In a plain table, could both an alphabet index and a search bar be shown?

Can you group items in the second table (plain table) further? If so, the interface is much simplified.

IDEA 2: Filtering

If IDEA 1 is impossible to follow, then you can do another thing. Implement a filter feature to the long list. Just place an icon at the top of the list. Clicking on it should bring a new page. Provide checkboxes, sliders, or some other facility according to your situation. Avoid the search bar if possible -- users don't know what words you have used in your list.

IDEA 3: Sorting

If IDEA 2 fails, then you must sort and present the list manually. Think about the options again and decide which are the most used options? Guess what most users want. Show those options first!

Use icons or pictures relating to the actions/properties of the items in the list. This allows easy scanning.

It tells me to run this sudo dpkg-configure -a and when I run this command the terminal process stops in the middle and even after leaving it for about an hour it doesn't proceed. After that when I want to close the terminal, it says that the terminal is in hte middle of a process, and closing it would interrupt it.

I would very much like to use a hybrid, but I've had trouble making one that would work at early levels (we are starting at 1).  I know there are many ways to have unconventional characters (such as a ranged healer) and I'm open to those ideas as well. 

I don't want to be, just another striker, or just another tank.  

I do enjoy all classes, but enjoy tanks and healers that lean towards strikers the best.  

How can I make a hybrid character which is unique but not useless at low levels?

There are only so many options available to characters in 4e. Sure you can come up with a great character design that no one else has created. But then you have to ask yourself the following questions


Does the character work (for whatever work means)?
Does the character fit in/fill a need in my party?
Can I play this character effectively?


If the answer to any of these questions is no then you need to re-evaluate your character creation strategies. Go for a simpler character and spend more time thinking about the character's story.

As much fun as it is to come up with a mechanically ""unique"" character, I personally thing its much more compelling to have a mechanically useful character with an interesting personality and back story to go with it.

  How many times do the two given curves intersect at the origin?

ContourPlot[{y^4 + 6 x^3*y + x^8 == 0, y - x^3 == 0}, {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5}]


However, I have no idea how to find the the multiplicity of the zeros at the origin. I'm really stuck.
",Luiz Meier,https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/10618,"General approach

If {x0, y0} is a root of a polynomial system {p1, p2} such that there is no other root of the form {x0, y1}, the multiplicity is given by the multiplicity of the zero x0 of the resultant

Resultant[p1, p2, y]


We can compute the multiplicity of this zero with

SparseArray[
   CoefficientList[Resultant[p1, p2, y] /. x -&gt; x0 + u, u]
 ][""NonzeroPositions""][[1, 1]] - 1


If a root {x0, y0} lines up with another root {x0, y1}, a linear transformation of the variables can always be found so that moves all the other roots off the line x = x0.  So in principle, this method can be applied to any system.

OP's example

In the OP's case, the command can be simplified a little since x0 == 0:

SparseArray[
   CoefficientList[Resultant[y^4 + 6 x^3*y + x^8, y^2 - x^3, y], x]
 ][""NonzeroPositions""][[1, 1]] - 1
(*
  6
*)


Comparison

I assume the OP wants a method, not just the answer.  (The OP's is simple enough to do, plug in x^3 for y, in one's head after all.)  We compare the NSolve method and @belisarius's Solve method with the Resultant method.

My original method was to use NSolve, which seems to work although the docs do not promise that it will, like this if we add Count as @belisarius did:

Count[NSolve[{p1 == 0, p2 == 0}, {x, y}], {x -&gt; 0.`, y -&gt; 0.`}]


Generalizing @belisarius's answer, I would get something like

Count[Solve[p1 == 0 /. #, x, Reals] &amp; /@ Solve[p2 == 0, y] // Flatten, x -&gt; 0]


which indeed yields 6 on the OP's example.

A more difficult example

Now let's consider the system with y^2 replacing y in the second polynomial:

p = {y^4 + 6 x^3*y + x^8, y^2 - x^3};


The two solve-based methods give different answers:

Count[NSolve[p == {0, 0}, {x, y}], {x -&gt; 0.`, y -&gt; 0.`}]
(* 9 *)

Count[Solve[p[[1]] == 0 /. #, x, Reals] &amp; /@ Solve[p[[2]] == 0, y] // Flatten, x -&gt; 0]
(* 10 *)


One solution gets counted twice in the Solve method, I guess, because the Resultant method yields

SparseArray[CoefficientList[Resultant[p[[1]], p[[2]], y], x]][""NonzeroPositions""][[1, 1]] - 1
(* 9 *)


Failure on repeated x0 - and the workaround

If we add some factors to the OP's system so that {x, y} = {0, 1} is a root, all the current solutions fail to yield 6:

p = {(y^4 + 6 x^3*y + x^8) (x^2 + (y - 1)^2), (y - x^3) (y - 1)};

Count[NSolve[p == {0, 0}, {x, y}], {x -&gt; 0.`, y -&gt; 0.`}]
(* 3 *)

Count[Solve[p[[1]] == 0 /. #, x, Reals] &amp; /@ Solve[p[[2]] == 0, y] // 
  Flatten, x -&gt; 0]
(* 8 *)

SparseArray[CoefficientList[Resultant[p[[1]], p[[2]], y], x]][""NonzeroPositions""][[1, 1]] - 1
(* 8 *)


Edit: Actually NSolve gets close, literally.  Numerical error leads to three of the roots being slightly off:

Count[Chop[NSolve[p == {0, 0}, {x, y}], 10^-50], {x -&gt; 0, y -&gt; 0}]
(* 6 *)


One can also use the Resultant method by transforming the coordinates so that the root {0, 1} is moved off the line x = 0:

With[{p = p /. {x -&gt; x + y, y -&gt; y}},
 SparseArray[CoefficientList[Resultant[p[[1]], p[[2]], y], x]][""NonzeroPositions""][[1, 1]] - 1]
(* 6 *)


Simply switching x and y also works in this case.



Orginal answer -- NSolve gives the correct multiplicity in V10

NSolve will return the multiplicity, which turns out to be 6 in this case:

NSolve[{y^4 + 6 x^3*y + x^8 == 0, y - x^3 == 0}, {x, y}, Reals]
(*
  {{x -&gt; 0., y -&gt; 0.}, {x -&gt; 0., y -&gt; 0.}, {x -&gt; 0., y -&gt; 0.},
   {x -&gt; 0., y -&gt; 0.}, {x -&gt; 0., y -&gt; 0.}, {x -&gt; 0., y -&gt; 0.}}

1181,How to determine directions of vectors of an electromagnetic wave,"I did an exercise which probably is quite popular,
in which you draw an electromagnetic wave and prove that it should
propagate at the speed of light $1 \over \sqrt {\mu_0\epsilon_0}$ using Farday's law and Ampere's law.

Basically if this is the wave: 




Let's say the E-field (red) is in the X direction, the B-Field (blue) is in the Y direction,
and the velocity of the wave is in the Z direction.

You take for example for ampere's law a surface in the ZY plane with a length L
equal to the amplitude of the wave,
and a width equal to $\lambda\over 4$
You do a similar thing with Faraday's law and you get the speed of light,
assuming you know that the E-field and B-field propagate in this manner.

I got the right answer but I wondered about this:
Let's say I only had the E-field and I know the wave propagates at the speed of light, I assume this is enough information to draw the B-field at each point.

But how will I know the direction? Both Faraday's law and Ampere's law say you need a closed loop integral and the rules I've been taught say
you go over the loop in a clockwise direction for example and take the 
normal to the surface according to the right hand rule etc.

But clockwise and counter-clockwise direction don't really give me much information in this case, so how can I determine the direction of the B-field
if I only have the E-field?
",fiftyeight,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/6743,"If you're careful about how you define the surface, then you will get the correct direction out of Maxwell's equations. In vector calculus (and generally in math and physics), a surface has an orientation, which also specifies the orientation of the loop that forms its boundary. So you can't just pick a direction to go around the loop at random. The direction in which you go around the loop is related to the orientation of the normal vector to the surface.

Of course, you don't actually need to do a surface integral to figure this out. The electric and magnetic fields in an EM wave (at any given position and moment in time) are related by the equation

$$\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c}\hat{\mathbf{k}}\times\mathbf{E}$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{k}}$ is a unit vector that points in the direction of propagation of the wave. If you don't know which direction the wave is moving, you can't tell which way the magnetic field points.

8158,Drywall - final joint compound coat,"While remodeling an older house (where nothing is quite straight) we used fiber glass mesh joint tape and 3 coats of joint compound. The first coat was applied with a 4 inch knife, the second with an 8 inch and ending the third on a 12 inch knife. I can still see the texture from the mesh tape I used on some of the joints.

I hoped that a coat of primer would level it off, but after using Kilz 2 primer I can still see the tape in some spots. :(

Sanding through the primer now proves difficult (doesn't work) with a medium grit sanding block.

Should I add another coat? I could never quite get the joint compound to adhere over the mesh tape. I've always been taught to go as thin as I can on the joint compound to reduce the sanding part. Did I go too thin? 

I'm hoping a second coat of primer and 2 coats of the final latex paint hides it, but I know this isn't the right answer. How can I fix this?



following what doresoom and shirlock said; i just applied a coat with the 12 inch knife practically against the wall (accidentally touching the wall with the handle once or twice) - more or less dragging the compound across the surface

this produced the result explained - about 1/32nd ? thickness of mud, covering the tape that i'll need to feather round the edges

i miss spoke earlier - i was using a sponge sanding block (not strait paper sand paper)

now that the primer has dried (did it saturday) its not as bad as i thought it was, but this is the right way to do it (not covering it with paint)

just as a side, we've used sherwin williams paint throughout the house and although its great paint (IMO) the plaster and lath walls that remain, even those repairs show through - and if those do, than this new work will... may as well do finish it right...

thanks for the help guys - i'll check this coat tomorrow and give a last one with the soap and water if it needs it.
",lsiunsuex,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/1154,"I know this isn't the answer you want to hear, but I don't think priming and painting will hide the tape. 

Before you apply any more primer, I'd add another thicker coat of mud. Slather on the mud thick first - it doesn't have to be smooth. Then smooth it out by angling your 12"" knife so it's almost parallel with the drywall as you drag it along the surface. You'll have to press fairly firmly in order to avoid air gaps appearing in the thick coat you're smoothing out.

You may have to get a feel for it. If you push too hard and can see the tape again, redo that section until you get it just right.

Wait for the thicker coat to dry, then sand the edges as smooth as you can get them. Very carefully/lightly sand over area covering the tape if you didn't get it quite smooth. You may need to do a second coat along both sides of the thicker coat to make it join the drywall surface smoothly.

9153,Information to include with a fine art print?,"I am just beginning to sell some of my images and would like to personalize them a little.  Many photographers sign and title their work on the white space just below the printed image. I am having metal prints made so there is no matting or white space, so I considered printing small (2""x3.5"") stickers to place on the back of the images. What information do you think should be included on that sticker? Pretty much everything I've found online talks about a certificate of authenticity and limited editions. I do not want limited editions but would like to sign and number my larger prints. Does anyone have experience with this? Do I need to print a separate certificate? At this juncture my sticker will have my logo, image title, artist name (me), place for my signature and date, ""edition #xx of an open edition"". Some sites mention including the date the photograph was taken; format (i.e. 24""x36"" photographic print on metal), though it seems redundant since it will be on the back of the print; same goes for description of artwork, as well as copyright as I am signing and dating it. I do plan on printing a second sticker with care instructions (i.e. hang indoors and out of direct sunlight etc.).  

Revision to clarify:
What information should be included? Do I need to put copyright information if I am signing it? Is it necessary to include the format of the print or the shot on date?  Should I also be providing a certificate of authenticity?

1 I fully appreciate the irony of the question, in light of the meta question.
",Wikis,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/62,"This article at Christian Post summarizes the controversy pretty well.

The beginning of the disagreement came when Rob Bell published a book called Love Wins. In it, he espouses a theology of hell which many read as universalism, the idea that God saves everyone, and that hell is not eternal.  In response, John Piper simply tweeted ""Farewell, Rob Rob Bell.""

To compound matters, Bell resigned from the church he started - Mars Hill - to begin a speaking tour. As Rick Warren calls it, doing that created a situation in which there is ""full visibility and no accountability.""

This would bring in some additional revenue every time someone purchased a book via a link on this site. 

They could do similar things with other links as well. Amazon's simply the most obvious choice.

Anyone know any online tools to do this? 
",leeman24,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/30440,"The simplest was is to just divide your total dividends for the year by your starting capital for that year. For example, if you start with $100000 in capital and earn $5000 in dividends during the year your dividend yield for that year would be 5%. Even if you haven't fully invested your total capital during the year it is still available to be invested and the total should be used for the calculation.

Once the year has ended you will have a new balance for you capital, which is the value you should use in the following year.

An alternative to this calculation is to use your average capital for the year, add your starting and ending capital values and divide by 2. You may want to use this method if you trade often during the year instead of buying all your investments only at the start of the year.

Also, another thing to consider is whether you include the dividends as additions to your capital or if you withdrawal dividends when they are paid for your own cashflow. If you reinvest your dividends, then they should be included as part of your capital.

About the sounds, I think it is merely by interferometry, but I am not convinced, because the distances between our ears and the wavelength are not always comparable to one another.

What do you think about it?

",Isaac,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/2499,"With vision depth is determined by parallax.  This largely works for objects out to 100m or less.  Depth beyond that distance is assessed by familiarity with these objects, say large mountains or vistas, and experience with them.  

Depth with hearing is determined by two means.  A tone which is perceived louder in one ear than the other is usually perceived as having a direction based on that.  For lower frequency sounds phase differences between left and right auditory perception can be used by the brain to detect angular direction relative to the facial direction.  

Some species of whales are thought to generate a mental map of the ocean, where a blue whale in the Atlantic maps the outlay of the ocean bottom and coasts through echo location.  Clearly this indicates a huge amount of neural processing which uses these acoustical data.  Dogs generate maps of their immediate world through olfactory means.

Best regards
",Spaso Lazarevic,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1817664,"You should use ExifLib for that. Unfourtunately it takes a bit more work since it's not 100% adapted to WP. 

1) Download the ExifLib ZIP, unzip it, unblock the DLL (right click --> Properties --> Unblock) and add a reference to it from your project. I've hosted the ZIP on my server in the meanwhile @ http://JustinAngel.net/Storage/ExifLib.zip

2) Next you'll have to create an entry function which is usable from windows phone. Here's the one I use: 

public class ExifReaderEx : ExifReader

        : base(stream)

        reader.info.LoadTime = (TimeSpan)(DateTime.Now - now);
        return reader.info;

}


3) Invoke the code by calling ExifReaderEx.ReadJpeg(myPicture). For example the following code snippet will return a list of Exif items with all metadata:

            var items = 
                new MediaLibrary().Pictures
                    .Select(picture =&gt; ExifReaderEx.ReadJpeg(picture))

6306,"What is best practice to handle whitespaces when letting the user edit the configuration, the name=value pairs?","For instance, you let the user define the notorious path variable. How do you interpret apppath = C:\Program Files\App?

This looks like a programming language adopted practice to ignore the white spaces and you leave them around the equality mark for readability, but it might be a valid variable value with white space in the application (consider, it is a suffix).

Even keys can contain whitespaces, can't they?

What is the general best practice for my application? If I have:

key-example = value-example


should I interpret the key being ""key-example"" or ""key-example "" and the value as being ""value-example"" or "" value-example""?
",Val,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/63834,"It's up to you to define the rules for your app.

For instance, you may define that:


Whitespace before or after the equality sign is ignored,
Whitespace inside the key is forbidden,
Whitespace inside the value can be used only if the value is enclosed in quotes, so:

say-hello = Hello, World!


is forbidden, while:

say-hello = ""Hello, World!""


is allowed, which also makes it possible to have whitespace prefixes:

say-hello = ""    Indentation is sweet.""



Defining a format may be a complex task. For instance:


How do you escape quotes?
How do you escape the escape character you use to escape quotes?
How do you handle empty values?
What is the maximum length of a key? What about a value?
How do you handle multiline values?
What about whitespace Unicode characters other than a space (such as a non-breaking space character)?
What about Unicode characters which are usually not displayed on the screen? For instance, how do you deal with Unicode categories Cf or Zl?
What are the characters allowed in the key? For example, is:

'


a valid key?
Should the following line work?¹

say-hello ꘌ ""Hello, World!""


Hint: the equality sign is not an equality sign, but the character 0xa60c (Vai syllable lengthener). Although few people would use this symbol instead of the equality, the more frequent case is a copy-paste from Microsoft Word (watch closely the quotation marks):

say-hello = “Hello, World!”

etc.


This is why, unless you are completely sure that you can define a format and describe it precisely and verbosely, use a format which already exists.

JSON or XML are commonly used formats you can use in nearly every programming language. You may even abstract the underlying format by using a database. Redis, for instance, is a popular solution for key-value store.



¹ Chrome users using Windows would probably see a question mark in a square. With other browsers or with Chrome on Linux, the character appears like an equality sign and can easily be misleading: the only visual difference is that there is a tiny difference in the space between the horizontal bars.

47,How do different tissue culture matrices affect background in fluorescent microscopy?,"In response to my previous question, I've been reading up a little bit on poly-D-lysine, Collagen I, Collagen IV, laminin, and other tissue culture coatings that promote cell adhesion. I've always assumed that anything other than standard TC-treated plastic or glass would significantly increase background, but perhaps my views on background fluorescence are a little outdated. Does anybody have experience with these in a fluorescent microscopy/high-throughput screening environment?

Specifically in my case, I'm looking at endocytosis and trafficking of a labeled protein into the lysosome. I'm labeling the protein with the pH-dependent dye pHrodoTM from Molecular Probes, which supposedly has very little fluorescence at neutral pH, but becomes very bright as the pH drops when endocytic vesicles become lysosomes. This theoretically means that a final wash step is not needed, but with a matrix coating on the plates I'm worried about background.

So, what is the current thinking as far as background fluorescence of the various TC matrices is concerned? Does the background come from the matrix itself, or by the fluorescent dye becoming adsorbed to it? Is it wavelength-dependent? Fortunately I may not be stuck with my poorly-adhering cells, and I may not need supplemental matrix at all in the end, but I still want a better understanding of how it works.

http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule

As Alexandrian says, have at least three clues per thing that you want the players to figure out. And as Bankuei says, make at least some of them obvious. Generally I use two tiers when making a mystery. There are three first tier clues that point to the person/location/thing that the players need to run into. But when the players enter the mystery, what they find first are second tier clues to the first tier clues or places they can find other second tier clues.

So lets say we have a murder mystery. We come up with three first tier clues: the guy who acted as lookout while the murder was committed, the murder weapon, and the fact that the two victims knew the murderer.

We decide that we have three second tier sources of clues: The two crime scenes, and the CCTV network that one player has access to.

At the first crime scene are stab wounds that will match the murder weapon, a witness who saw the lookout and can describe him, and the matchbooks that the lookout dropped at his lookout point, which points to his favorite bar.

At the second crime scene are stab wounds that will match the murder weapon, a witness who saw where the murderer disposed of the murder weapon, and a series of emails between the murdered and murderer which shows they had business ties.

The CCTV network will show the outlook at the second crime scene, and the fact that the murderer frequently visited both victims. He looked very angry when he visited the second victim before the day before the murder.

To shore up the outlook clues, we'll also decide that the outlook is a petty crook, so his name and address can be found by finding him in the criminal database (if they know what he looks like).

Finally our first tier clues: The murder weapon has the murderer's finger prints and his initials on the grip.

The outlook can be made to spill the beans. He knows exactly who the murderer is.

And digging into the emails and other records will reveal that the three were engaged in shady business deals, where the murderer was getting the short end of the stick.

961,Take quick notes without interrupting current activity,"When I’m in the middle of something and get an idea, I want to note it down without interrupting what I’m doing.

Desired workflow: adding a note


I press a key (or a key combo).
(should work everywhere: while browsing, while writing, while watching a video, etc.)
A note window opens.
(just a single text field, no title/category/etc.)
(it must be empty)
(doesn’t have to be a GUI)
I enter my note.
I press, e.g. Enter to save the note.
(the window must close automatically)


Browsing notes


Just a simple list/table of all saved notes.

Especially not just text files which I’d have to open separately to read their content.

Should display the date/time when a note was saved.
Should offer a quick way to delete notes.
No need for editing notes.


Formal requirements

A solution must be FLOSS and run natively on GNU/Linux.
",unor,https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/users/60,"Sounds like a job for Emacs!

Install Emacs through your distribution's package manager.

Emacs comes with Remember Mode, which does pretty much what you want. (Note that there's a lot of complication in the Emacs Wiki that you don't care about, because it's for older versions of Emacs. Remember Mode is bundled since Emacs 23.)

To start taking a note, run the following shell command:

emacsclient -a """" -e ""(let ((pop-up-frame-alist \`((window-system . x) (display . \""$DISPLAY\"") ,@pop-up-frame-alist))) (remember-other-frame))""


(Having just -e ""(remember-other-frame)"" doesn't work if Emacs isn't already displaying a window due to a bad interaction between server mode and frame creation.)
You can add other frame parameters in that list, with the syntax (NAME . VALUE). For example, to set a smaller height:

emacsclient -a """" -e ""(let ((pop-up-frame-alist \`((window-system . x) (display . \""$DISPLAY\"") (height . 8) ,@pop-up-frame-alist))) (remember-other-frame))""


Bind that shell command to a key in your window manager or desktop environment; each has its own way of doing this, so I can't describe them all.

Emacs will start if it isn't already running, and a new Emacs window showing an empty file will pop up. When you've finished taking that note, press Ctrl+C twice. If you want to change that key binding, you can do it in your .emacs, for example to use Ctrl+Return, use this code:

(require 'remember)
(define-key remember-mode-map [C-return] 'remember-finalize)


If you want to save some text from another application, copy it to the clipboard and run this command (which you may want to bind to a key as well):

emacsclient -a """" -c -e ""(remember-clipboard)""


With this command, you need to press Ctrl+C twice, then close the window.

The notes are saved in the file ~/.notes (each new note is appended to that file). A header containing ** followed by the current time is automatically added at the beginning of the note.

To browse the notes, just open ~/.notes in your favorite text editor (such as Emacs).

If you want to save the notes to a different file, add a line like this to your ~/.emacs:

(setq remember-data-file ""/path/to/notes/file"")


What Remember mode lacks out of the box is a really convenient way of deleting a single note. You can of course select the text and delete it. Here's a function to delete the current note, plus a bit of infrastructure to bind it to a key when browsing the notes file. Put this code in your ~/.emacs.

(defun remember-current-note-extent ()

      (end-of-line)

The cooking devices that many people refer to as ""hibachi"" are what the Japanese would call ""shichirin"":



I'm guessing that the term ""hibachi"" was popularized in North America because ""shichirin"" can be hard to pronounce for Anglophones.

Somewhere along the way, primarily in North America, the term ""hibachi"" also started to be used to refer to teppanyaki:



I'm not sure when or why this started; perhaps it has something to do with the fact that Banihana confusingly refers to their teppanyaki restaurants as ""hibachi-style"".

Among these, teppanyaki is most similar to Mongolian barbecue, in which meat is cooked on large, round, cast iron griddles:



(Images taken from Wikipedia.)

If you were to actually go to a Japanese restaurant and cook your own food over a shichirin, it would likely be referred to as ""yakiniku"", which is believed to have some origins in Korean barbecue.

Whereas teppanyaki has been a traditional Japanese cooking method for a long time, ""Mongolian barbecue"" was developed in the 1970s in Taipei, Taiwan.  During that time, Japanese Teppanyaki was very popular in Taiwan, so many people speculate that was actually the inspiration for Mongolian barbecue.  There are also some similarities between the Japanese dish ""jingisukan"" and Mongolian barbecue, however, jingisukan predates Mongolian barbecue.

When it comes time to apply for postdoc or junior faculty positions, could choosing to take elective courses Pass/Fail negatively impact hiring or funding decisions? For example, suppose a postdoc advertisement states that the position requires knowledge of a technique or area covered in an elective course. Would the fact that an applicant received a ""Pass"" in the course be considered the same as if the grade was instead an A or B? Alternatively, is it better to risk getting a B (or C) in a hard elective course instead of ""playing it safe"" by electing to Pass/Fail the course (where A, B, and C all get the same grade)? Are there any situations where the choice between letter grade vs. Pass/Fail can impact anything negatively or positively?

I've often heard that grades don't matter as much in graduate school compared to things like research output and networking, which may make this question a bit irrelevant. Still, I would be curious what others think.
",Florian D'Souza,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/26958,"Unless you're applying for a post-doctoral position at a corporation or somewhere else where HR personnel will be screening your materials before forwarding them to the person doing the hiring (where GPA might be scrutinized), I don't think it frankly makes much difference.

9460,AES using derived keys / IVs. Does it introduce a weakness?,"I'm looking for an efficient way to encrypt multiple fields in a database with AES using a single global key, used throughout a large web application.

Obviously in order to re-use this key, a unique random IV is required for each field that is to be encrypted.

I'd rather not introduce more fields to the database to store each of these IVs, so the programatic approach seems to be to derive these IVs some how.

I'm toying with using either:

key = sha256(global_key + table_name)
iv = sha256(column_name + primary_key)


Or even simply:

key = global_key
iv = sha256(table_name + column_name + primary_key)


I'm leaning towards the former to generate per-table keys.

I've already read that the IVs do not need to be kept secret. So I'm working on the assumption that a derived key or IV (even if the algorithm becomes known), is no more insecure than any other non-secret IV, as long as the original key remains secret.

The question is:

Is there a fatal flaw in my approach? Am I introducing any serious weaknesses that, in the event that an adversary obtains a copy of the database, would make it easier for them to retrieve the plaintext data?

I realise that is potentially soliciting one word answers.

Suggestions for alternate / better schemes very much welcomed, as well as references to existing works and how they implement similar scenarios.
",Leigh,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/1349,"Your approach is insecure.  If you modify some value in the database, you'll be encrypting a new value using the same IV as you used to encrypt the prior value.  (The data will be stored in the same place, so the table name, column name, and primary key will remain unchanged.)  This might compromise confidentiality.  The compromise is especially bad if you are using a stream cipher or AES-CTR or similar mode, as then you've encrypted two different values using the same stream, a classic keystream-reuse vulnerability (the two-time pad is highly insecure).

Instead, it is better to do as others recommend: generate a random IV, and store it together with the ciphertext.  Indeed, in most modes of operation, you can consider the IV to be part of the ciphertext.

also how would one obtain fossils aside from the original glittering cave ones thanks
",that guy,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/79887,"'Most effective' ways might be subjective. I do prefer the Friend Safari because of the guaranteed 31 IVs in at least 2 stats; which can't be easily obatined otherwise unless you search thoroughly.

Usually you can trade; friend, GTS, acquaintance and people sometimes put pokemon with 31 IVs in particular stats in GTS (you can identify them with their description, for example 31 HS usually means 31 IVs in HP and Speed).

You could say that this one's a lot faster, but it really depends on when you check GTS out. For instance, starters would be easily obtained early after the release, and I haven't been there lately but I think that the GTS activity might have died down a bit when compared to before.

For the fossils, again you can use the GTS if you don't have someone willing or able to trade you one. Another option though is to check out the Glittering Cave and Rock Smash boulders again and again (just exit the main cave and come back in to have the boulders appear again) though you might consider this as taking a long time. Took me a few days to be able to get at least one of each fossil (of course I didn't just look for fossils)

To get a basis from comparison, you can look at the current code to publish a Cursor, which is  in packages/mongo-livedata/mongo_driver.js, in Cursor.prototype._publishCursor.

Which I guess is feasible, IF I am also able to dynamically change the variable to work for the new content that needs to be posted on said page.

Is there better methods? Would PHP work for this? Any suggestions would help.
",Josh,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2476769,"In general, I would do it more or less like this:

1. Create a 'Blogs' SQL database table.
Create an 'id' column (primary key), and columns for fields like 'blog_date', 'title', 'author', and 'html_content'.

2. Create a 'Blog' class using php.
Create properties which correspond to the SQL fields in your 'Blogs' table, including 'id'.

3. Create public 'loadFromDB()' and 'saveToDB()' methods
These methods should load and save the SQL values of a row in 'Blogs' (selected by id) to and from the class properties.

4. Create a public 'view()' method for the 'Blog' class
This is simply an HTML view/template of a single blog entry displaying date, title, author, etc.

5. Create an 'index.php' blog page in a folder on the server
You want to use this page to display a single blog entry.
Use a blog's SQL id when calling this page from links in your main blogs page, for example via http GET: 'http://www.yoursite.com/blogs/blog/index.php?id=30'.  In your php code inside index.php, where you want the entry to appear, do something like this:  

$id_default = 27;  // the blog entry which must appear when there is no query parameter
$id = empty($_GET['id']) ? $id_default : $_GET['id'];
$B = new Blog($id);
$B-&gt;loadFromDB();
$html = $B-&gt;view();
echo $html;


In this way, you don't have to create an HTML page for EVERY blog entry, or put ALL the entries on one page.  You can just use one page created dynamically with a GET parameter instead.

Obviously there is more you can/must do, such as creating commenting displays and forms and a 'Comments' SQL table, etc.  But this should give you some ideas.

OTOH profiles do include makefiles. It is a common practice for a different use case, where discovery and recursion is desired.

When I read the documentation, they both appear the same to me from the metadata perspective. I would like to know how I can use it for retrieving metadata.  How is the tooling API specifically different from metadata API for retrieving metadata?
",Kevin Bellati,https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/13059,"While there is overlap, the Tooling API is specifically designed to help developers build IDE apps for salesforce, while the metadata API is more general purpose configuration migration. For example, you can get a symbol table for a class, such as it's members and functions, without writing your own parser. The metadata API is suitable for simple migrations, but the Tooling API gives developers a platform for debugging, code coverage, auto complete, and more.

Consider the migration toolkit versus the Force.com IDE, and you'll see the difference. One lets you move configuration changes, the other lets you develop new code entirely (minus, if course, the fact that auto complete isn't present in current IDE builds). The Developer Console also shows the power of the Tooling API.

Technically, the Tooling API could completely replace the metadata API, since the metadata API, came first and is less powerful, but it will be supported for some time to come yet.

New projects should probably use the Tooling API as much as practical, but the metadata API is widely supported, in comparison, so it will be a while yet until it is completely replaced.

The configuration with the load in the emitter is called common collector, or emitter-follower. It is characterized by a high current amplification, but no (slightly less than 1) voltage amplification. This means that, with a very low current, the transistor can switch a much larger current. But the input voltage must be at least the load voltage.

In a lot of cases the common-emitter is more appropriate, but in power end-stages you will often find the emitter follower.

Of the two, I suggest msmtp.

Configuration is complicated enough that I'm not sure if I should replicate all of the steps here, but I will mention that if you use
Homebrew
you can install msmtp using

brew install msmtp --with-macosx-keyring

Then the rest is just a matter of setting up the related configuration files

The first is /usr/local/etc/msmtprc

# Begin msmtprc
# Set default values for all following accounts.
defaults
tls on
logfile ~/.msmtp.log

# A first gmail address
account example@gmail.com
host smtp.gmail.com
port 587
protocol smtp
auth on
from example@gmail.com
user example@gmail.com
tls on
tls_starttls on

# this next line is crucial: you have to point to the correct security certificate for GMail.
# If this doesn't work, check the mstmp documentation
# at http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/documentation.html for help
#
# This next line should all be on one long line:
tls_trust_file /path/to/Thawte Roots/Thawte SSLWeb Server Roots/thawte Premium Server CA/Thawte Premium Server CA.pem

# Set a default account
# You need to set a default account for Mail
account default : example@gmail.com

# end msmtprc


Note that tls_trust_file line should point to wherever you have downloaded and installed the certificates from https://www.thawte.com/roots/index.html.

I put mine in ~/Dropbox/Thawte Roots so that I can have it on all of my Macs.

Then you need a ~/.mailrc file to say where the msmtp binary is located. If you use brew it will be /usr/local/bin/msmtp so the file would look like this:

set sendmail=""/usr/local/bin/msmtp""


The last but crucial step is making sure your Keychain has the information exactly in the format that msmtp will expect it:

In The Chamber of Secrets:


   Harry retrieves Goderic Gryffindor's sword from the sorting hat during the confrontation with the basilisk. After this Dumbledore keeps hold of the sword in a glass case in his office. 


Then in The Deathly Hallows:


   Harry and Ron do a deal with Griphook to return Gryffindor's sword to the goblins after they have retrieved Hufflepuff's cup, planning to partially double cross him by holding on to it until all the horcruxes have been destroyed. However Griphook double crosses them first, and keeps hold of the sword.


Then, in the battle at the end of the book:


   Voldemort puts the sorting hat on Neville Longbottom's head and sets him on fire. Instead of burning Neville pulls Gryffindor's sword out of the sorting hat and beheads Nagini, destroying Voldemort's last horcrux.


However, if the sword could always be pulled out of the hat by someone sufficiently heroic then why the need to:


   Create a copy of the sword to fool Bellatrix Lestrange into thinking she had the real one in Gringott's vault? Why forge a copy and risk Snape placing it in the lake if it could always have been pulled from the sorting hat, regardless of where it was or how it was protected?

In Deathly Hallows, page 689, chapter 23:


   ""Now, Severus, the sword!  Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of NEED and VALOR...""


(The emphasis is mine)

The short answer is that the magic of the sword and the hat worked together to provide the sword to Neville.

It appeared to him since Neville fulfilled all the qualities necessary for the sword to appear in the Sorting Hat:


true Gryffindor:  Sorting Hat put Neville in the house
need:  Neville needed to kill Nagini

That is to say, if a sequential design is used, initial patients are recruited and treated. Part way through the study, the currently collected data gets analyzed. Three possible actions can occur at this point: the data may show a statistically significant result and the study will be stopped because efficacy has been demonstrated, the data many statistically significantly show that there is no strong effect (for example, the upper end of the confidence interval is below some clinically significant threshold) and the study is stopped due to futility or the data is not yet conclusive (i.e. both a clinically significant effect and a clinically insignificant effect are contained in the confidence interval) in which more data will be collected. So you can see that in this case, the sample size is not fixed. 

An important note about this: you can't just run a standard test each time you ""check"" your data, otherwise you are doing multiple comparisons! Because the test statistics at different times should be positively correlated, it's not as big an issue as standard multiple comparison issues, but it still should be addressed for proper inference. Clinical trials, being regulated by the FDA, must state a plan for how they will address this (as @AdamO points out, SeqTrial provides software for this). However, often times academic researchers, not being regulated by the FDA, will continue to collect data until they find significance without adjusting for the fact that they are doing several comparisons. It's not the biggest abuse of statistical practice in research, but it still is an abuse.

I've scoured the internet, and cannot find a way to do this (that works). It's possible to remove whole top level menus (not what I need), and you can remove individual entries from the $submenu global (but doing that also removes the registered capability), so no one can access the page -

global $submenu;
if(!empty($submenu['charts'])) : foreach($submenu['charts'] as $key =&gt; $page) :

            /** Removes the title, but the menu entry still exists, so it looks odd */
            $submenu['charts'][$key][0] = '';

    endforeach;

I've looked in to hiding it via CSS, but can't see a way to do that through the HTML that Wordpress generates -

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""admin.php?page=edit-chart"" tabindex=""1""&gt;Edit Chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;


I've also considered jQuery, but that has similar limitations to the CSS route, plus I refust to believe that I am the only one that has ever wished to do this - there must be a way, I just can't find it!

6088,Constantly lag in opengl application,"I'm getting some repeating lags in my opengl application.
I'm using the win32 api to create the window and I'm also creating a 2.2 context.
So the main loop of the program is very simple:


Clearing the color buffer
Drawing a triangle
Swapping the buffers.


The triangle is rotating, that's the way I can see the lag.
Also my frame time isn't smooth which may be the problem.
But I'm very very sure the delta time calculation is correct because I've tried plenty ways.

Do you think it could be a graphic driver problem?
Because a friend of mine run almost the exactly same program except I do less calculations + I'm using the standard opengl shader.
Also, His program use more CPU power than mine and the CPU % is smoother than mine.

I should also add:
On my laptop I get same lag every ~1 second, so I can see some kind of pattern.
",user1312724,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1312724,"There are many reasons for a jittery frame rate.  Off the top of my head:


Not calling glFlush() at the end of each frame
other running software interfering
doing things in your code that certain graphics drivers don't like
bugs in graphics drivers
Using the standard windows time functions with their terrible resolution


Try these:


kill as many running programs as you can get away with.  Use the process tab in the task manager (CTRL-SHIFT-ESC) for this.
bit by bit, reduce the amount of work your program is doing and see how that affects the frame rate and the smoothness of the display.
if you can, try enabling/disabling vertical sync (you may be able to do this in your graphic card's settings) to see if that helps
add some debug code to output the time taken to draw each frame, and see if there are anomalies in the numbers, e.g. every 20th frame taking an extra 20ms, or random frames taking 100ms.

158,What does “bupke” mean?,"There was the following passage in the New Yorker's (August 27) article titled, “A scandal at the C.I.A. May be.” :


  In January I (David Shafer, novelist) filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the C.I.A., asking for any information relating to my grandfather and Thomas Whittemore and the events of June 1950. They took two months to give me bupkes. But to give me bupkes, they were required to invoke a FOIA exemption, and the exemption that C.I.A. involved were (b)(3), which means the records are protected by another federal statute, and (b)(1) ---


Though I was unable to find the definition of “bupke” in OED (10th ed.), OALD (2000), and Collins Cobuild (4th ed.) at hand, I happened to find its definition at bageldrive.com, which says “bupke” is;


  A mini-bagel deliciously baked to perfection with fully functional USB 2.0 flash memory and a shmeer. It’s the world’s first electronic bagel. The Bagel Drive is ideal for storing files, photos, video, music and all of your digital tchochkes.　The site also shows photos of USB attached to plastic bagel models.


What does bupke mean? Is it a flash memory in a bagel shape as described in bagldrive com.? Does it pass as the generic term of flash memory? 

Beside, I wonder why CIA takes bother of using such a funky shape of all flash memories to provide data to the requester.

2586,Rate-limiting in transition state theory,"Suppose an initial state $A$ can transition to either state $C$ or state $D$. Suppose further that both of these two processes are rate-limited by a transition to the same intermediate state $B$, as follows:



Note that $\Delta G_{AB}&gt; \Delta G_{BC}&gt;\Delta G_{BD}$.

According to transition state theory, rates are determined by the rate-limiting step. So the rate of each process will be the same,

\begin{align}
r_{A\to C}&amp;=r_{A\to B} \\
r_{A\to D}&amp;=r_{A\to B}
\end{align}

from which it follows that the number of transitions made during some large $\Delta t$ will also be the same,

\begin{align}
N_{A\to C}&amp;=r_{A\to B}\Delta t \\
N_{A\to D}&amp;=r_{A\to B}\Delta t
\end{align}

However, if we were to consider the two pathways collectively then we would predict more transitions to be made to state $D$ than $B$ since $\Delta G_{BD}&lt;\Delta G_{BC}$.

How do we resolve this apparent discrepancy?
",lemon,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/7265,"On remark: just because activation energy high/low it doesn't necessarily mean that reaction is slow or fast. You cannot tell this without the pre-exponential factor. 

The answer: Off course, the original statement should not applied as you do it. 
""According to transition state theory, rates are determined by the rate-limiting step."" doesn't mean automatically that all the reaction rates are equal.

A to B conversion is slow compared to other processes, is true, but still B to C and B to D are competing processes. The original statement only means that B will not build up in bigger quantities, so during the reaction all the final products (C and D together) are approximately equal with the used A after you consider stoichimetries.

Edited for clarification (sorry, pretty new to LaTex):

You should consider all the transformations as independent equations. Black magic is not involved, ""rate determining step"" and such only helps making approximations so one can solve the coupled differential equations on napkin.

Example 1. 

Let us assume a reaction system with $A \to B \to C$. The kinetics of the system can be describe by two independent equations

$A \to B$ with a corresponding $k1$ and  $B \to C$ with a corresponding $k2$

To describe conversions we can get different equations:

$$ \frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k1 [A] $$ 

$$ \frac{d[B]}{dt} = k1 [A] - k2 [B]$$ 

$$ \frac{d[C]}{dt} = k2 [B] $$ 

We see that it is already pretty messy, so assumptions like $k1 &lt;&lt; k2$ can help. The general way is that we say, this difference in the rate constants allows us to asume  $$ \frac{d[B]}{dt} \approx 0 $$. So we have  pipeline, and in first approximation have that much $B \to C$ conversion going as $A \to B$. I.e. the is no ""clogging"" in the middle. Not much magic here.

Example 2.

Now what if we have e.g. two slow reactions as second step instead of one? Noting special:
$A\to B$ , with $k1$,
$B\to C$ , with $k2$,
$B\to D$ , with $k3$ 
which translates to 

$$ \frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k1 [A] $$ 

$$ \frac{d[B]}{dt} = k1 [A] -( k2 [B] + k3 [B])$$ 

$$ \frac{d[C]}{dt} = k2 [B] $$ 

$$ \frac{d[D]}{dt} = k3 [B] $$ 

Now we have the same assumption that the first step is much slower than the others than 

$$ \frac{d[B]}{dt} = k1 [A] -( k2 [B] + k3 [B]) \approx 0$$

I think you can try it from here and see how the rates comes out.

I've found a similar projection with a valid srid code, NAD83 / North Carolina (ftUS) (srid=2264), which has a proj4 string nearly identical to the above:

9232,Why does Wizards of the Coast print terrible MTG cards?,"I understand that there needs to be a wide variety of power levels in Magic: The Gathering. Even bad cards will see play in limited formats, some because they fill a specific niche (flying removal, fat colorless flyer, providing a counter to certain decks), and others because those decks can't afford to be too picky. However, some cards are just unforgivably terrible. I'm talking about cards that you would only run in sealed if you had absolutely no other options:

Mindless Null: Black 2/2 for 3 with a big disadvantage

Defensive Stance: literally does nothing in exchange for you getting card disadvantage 

Merfolk of the Depths: Would still be bad if it only costed 5...

Archangel's Light: 8 mana just to gain some life and put cheap cards back into your deck. And it's a mythic rare....

There are many more examples, but I think these best illustrate my case. Obviously I'd rather have these cards in the game than not have them at all, but I feel like Wizards of the Coast could have made Magic a more enjoyable game just by keeping the flavor and making all of these cards a tiny bit better...yet they didn't. Why?
",Gordon Gustafson,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/191,"Tom LaPille, When Cards Go Bad, Part 2, a followup to the first When Good Cards Go Bad article thesunneversets linked, has a few more points that haven't been fully explored yet.

Some cards aren't fun when they're good.

Here he uses the example of Scrambleverse, which has really cumbersome and complicated mechanics, explaining that it is costed very high so that it doesn't get played often. The only people that play it are the people that really want to.

Limited needs to be balanced.

I think Limited play is the biggest reason there are ""bad"" cards in modern MtG. From the article:


  …there was a meeting when both blue and black were doing much better than we wanted in our playtests. Lead developer Aaron Forsythe decreed that we needed a weak blue card and a weak black card. None of us came up with a blue card that was weak enough, so Aaron created Defensive Stance to fill the hole.


So while Defensive Stance does have some narrow infect-hosing mechanic, it was basically created just to keep blue drafters in New Phyrexia in check.

Draft needs to be human-processable.


  Drafting is a complex enough task already without every card being extremely close together in power, so we include plenty of cards of widely differing power levels so that the right answer can be a little bit less ambiguous. This doesn't simplify the task of correctly identifying those power levels—a challenging task in itself!—but it does make deciding between correctly-identified power levels a little bit easier.


Imagine if every card in a pack had the same power-level. I have a hard enough time deciding between two or three similar power-level cards in a draft. If all cards had a similar power level, each decision becomes stressful and agonizing. Drafts would slow to a crawl. If there are some ""last pick"" cards and definite common ""bombs"", it makes the draft a bit more smooth and manageable.

I am reading Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Step by Step which I feel it is a very good book on introducing you to the C# language.

I seem to be having problems in understanding the static keyword. From what I understand this far if a class is declared static all methods and variable have to be static. The main method always is a static method so in the class that the main method exists all variables and methods are declared static if you have to call them in the main method. Also I have noticed that in order to call a static method from another class you do not need to create an object of that you can use the class name.

What are the advantages of declaring static variables and methods?

",Nistor Alexandru,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/52164,"Here's Joshua Bloch's way of explaining it, which I find brilliant like most of what he says (yes I'm a Joshua Bloch fan boy :) ). This is quoted from memory.

Imagine that a class is the equivalent of a blue-print for a house. Image then that a house is to the blueprint as an instance of the class is for the class. You can have one class (blue-print) and multiple instances (houses) created from it.

Now common sense dictates that most of the functions/behaviors that a house (instance) can have/do, even though they are declared in the blue-print, cannot be used until an actual house (instance) is made out of that blue-print (class). Like, your blue print might contain in it the place where the light switches and the light bulbs should go, but you have no way of making those work on the blue-print, you have to actually build the house in order to be able to switch the light switch on and off and have certain light bulbs go on and off.

However, you might have some behavior that is applicable to the blue-print directly, and which you could use/access directly on the blue print without needing to make an actual house out of that blue print. Imagine that your blue-print has a button that, upon pressing, will display the footprint of the house contained in that blue print (by calculating all the lengths of the walls and such). Obviously you COULD build a house first, then go around measuring its footprint, but you can do this with he blue-print alone, so it would be more helpful to have this behavior implemented in the blue-print. Such a blue-print embedded button that calculates the footprint of the house is the equivalent of having a static function in a class.

",Searcher,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/35322,"If I'm understanding correctly, the problem you're concerned about is what to do when you've just submitted a paper, and now you have a long wait before you can submit the follow-up paper.  Your question then presumes that a good solution to this problem is to try to accelerate the publication process.

I think that is a bad assumption.  There is no reason that you need to be stalled on your forward progress just because a paper is under review.  Here are two good alternatives that work within the system.


You can continue directly building on the same direction.  If you get to a major milestone and are ready to submit a new paper before the previous one is finished reviewing, you can submit a paper citing the one under review as ""submitted,"" and include the draft paper as supplementary review-only information.
Research typically has a lot of ""branching path"" options getting catalogued in your ""future work"" sections.  Why not take a secondary path that you've wanted to investigate but isn't in the same exactly line of progression as the paper currently under review?  That will likely lead to its own interesting results that can be published without dependency on the paper currently under review.


It also seems possible to me that this concern may have arisen due to trying to publish too incrementally.  If you cluster your work into larger ""publication units"" the time lag will likely be less problematic and a smaller number of significant papers is generally better for your career than a bunch of little incremental papers that nobody cares about.

\end{document}


Explanation


Making diagrams (including function plotting) can be accomplished by using PSTricks (recommended because it is faster and easier to learn yet powerful) or TikZ  or others. The code above is written in PSTricks, you need to load \usepackage{pst-plot}.
To get a tight page, use 

\documentclass[pstricks,border=12pt]{standalone}

Define a canvas on which you draw.

\begin{pspicture}(-4.25,-1.25)(4.25,2.25)
 ... drawing codes go here ...
\end{pspicture}


(-4.25,-1.25) represents the bottom left point of your canvas and (4.25,2.25) is the top right point.
Define the function to plot.

\def\f(#1){sin(2*#1)+0.5}


In this example I chose y=sin(2x)+1/2.
Draw the coordinate axes.

\psaxes[labelFontSize=\scriptscriptstyle,ticksize=-2pt 2pt]{-&gt;}(0,0)(-4,-1)(4,2)[$x$,0][$y$,90]

Plot the graph.

\psplot[linecolor=blue,algebraic]{-\psPi}{\psPi}{\f(x)}

Put a label if necessary.

 \rput[tl](*1 {\f(x)+0.5}){$y=\sin(2x)+\frac{1}{2}$}


In PSTricks, we can specify a point in several ways. (*&lt;x-value&gt; {the value of expression in x for the given x}) is one of them. Thus (*1 {\f(x)+0.5}) mathematically means a point (x,y) where x=1 and y=f(1)+0.5.
Compile the input file with xelatex or the combo sequence latex-dvips-ps2pdf.
Done!


Miscellaneous

\psplot[linecolor=blue,algebraic,plotpoints=100]{Pi neg .5 sub}{Pi .5 add}{\f(x)}



The plotpoints can be used to increase the number of points used to plot the graph. But be wise, the greater its value is, the smoother the plot is but the bigger the file size becomes. For most extreme case, plotpoints=1000 should be more than enough. 
The first and second arguments of \psplot can accept RPN notation. In the example above, I used -π-.5 and π+.5 for both args, respectively. PSTricks gives you many good features, right?

Push all git repositories (5 times a day)
Do a virus scan on files (every 90 days)

It has a JSON config file for the tasks:

    ""disk"": true,
    ""internet"": true,

Do not run when running on battery.
Provide some visible status. That could be through kdialog even.
Run only one disk heavy task at a time.


The maintenance script takes care of that, and I can run it whenever I have sufficient time to let the tasks run. If not, I can just abort all the tasks and restart it later.

Plain cron would not be good, since it would not work when my computer is powered off. anacron might be better, but I assume that it would run all the tasks right after booting. Also, if I happen to need my disk for virtual machine, how would I tell the scheduler to stop?

Cron and anacron are (normally) daemon services.  You can stop and start them the way you stop and start any other service.


  cron would not be good, since it would not work when my computer is powered off


That's a pretty tough criterion to get around.  What is it you want the software to do while the computer is powered off?


  anacron might be better, but I assume that it would run all the tasks right after booting.


Apparently.  Here's an idea though: start and stop anacron with cron.


  Run only one disk heavy task at a time


Anacron has this option:


  -s
  Serializes execution of jobs.  Anacron does not start a new job before the previous one finished.


This just leaves you to implement these two:


Do not run when running on battery.
Provide some visible status. That could be through kdialog even.


The first could be accomplished by having cron check the battery status before it starts anacron.  The second could be done a wide variety of ways; you've already suggested one yourself.

4827,The graph has an Euler tour iff in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$),"I am looking at the proof that $G$ has an Euler tour iff in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$), that I found at this site: www.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall09/cps230/hws/hw3/headsol.pdf  (Problem 2)

A simple cycle is a path in a graph that starts and ends at the same vertex without passing through the same vertex more than once.

A complex cycle is a cycle that passes through the same vertex more than once. We can easily decompose a complex cycle to a set of simple cycles by breaking up the cycle at those points where the cycle passes through the same vertex more than once.

As the first part of our proof, we will prove that if $G$ has an Euler tour, in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$) for each vertex $v \in V$.

We have already established that a complex cycle can be decomposed to a collection of simple cycles. However vertices on a simple cycle have in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$)=1.

Since each vertex in a complex cycle, and therefore in an Euler tour, is part of one or more simple cycles it will have in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$).


Could you give me an example of a complex cycle that is decomposed to a set of simple cycles, where we can see that in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$)?


The second part of our proof requires us to prove that if in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$) for each vertex $v \in V$, $G$ has an Euler-tour.

Let $C$ be the complex cycle involving the most edges in $G$.

In order for $G$ not to be an Euler tour, there must be some vertices that $C$ passes through ( since the graph is connected ) but does not exhaust all edges. We have already established that the vertices of a complex cycle have the property that in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$). Therefore $G'=G-C$ will also have that property. If a connected component in a graph has in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$) then it contains at least one cycle $C'$. However this contradicts our initial hypothesis that $C$ is the cycle involving the most edges in $G$ since we would construct a larger cycle by starting at some common vertex of $C$ and $C'$, traversing all of $C$s edges and then $C'$s edges. Therefore $C$ is an Euler tour.


First of all, it says that ""In order for $G$ not to be an Euler tour, there must be some vertices that $C$ passes through ( since the graph is connected ) but does not exhaust all edges. "" 


I haven't understood why we have to show that $G$ does not exhaust all edges. In order for $G$ not to be an Euler tour, couldn't it also hold that  $G$ traverses an edge more than once?

Then it says that ""We have already established that the vertices of a complex cycle have the property that in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$). Therefore $G'=G-C$ will also have that property.""

Why will $G'=G-C$ be a complex cycle, although $G$ isn't necessarily?

Also, could you explain me why it holds that: "" If a connected component in a graph has in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$) then it contains at least one cycle $C'$.""

Finally, could you explain me the contradiction?

EDIT: I also want to describe an algorithm that runs in time $O(E)$ and finds an Euler tour of $G$, if it exists. (Hint: Merge edge-disjoint cycles.) 
If we apply DFS, we will get a set of cycles formed by disjoint sets of edges, right? But how can we know if it holds that in-degree(v)=out-degree(v), for all vertices in $V$?

Do we have to do something like that?  algorithm
",evinda,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/75843,"In a simple cycle the in degree and the out degree are both one, so if we add to some simple cycle another simple cycle at some vertex, the in degree and the out degree of the vertex will increase both by 1. 

You got some wrong concept on $G'$, it is not a complex cycle in fact it doesn't even need to be connected. As we defined cycles in my (algorithmic) dicrete math classes we said that every edge may be traversed at most once so it is not possible that $C$ is a complex cycle which traverses one edge more than once. 

So the idea is more that there must be some complex cycle which passes trough every vertex, because your graph is connected, and if uses every edge it is an euler tour. So we take the complex cycle with most edges, and look at $G'=G-C$, as the in degree of some vertex in $G'$ is the in degree of the vertex in $G$ minus the in degree of the vertex in $C$ and the same for the out degrees the graph $G'$ does still have the property, that the in degrees coincide with the out degrees. But if those degrees aren't all $0$ we could add some cycle to $C$ which would result in some complex cycle with more edges, which is some contradiction to our assumption, that $C$ does have the most edges.

Dictionary.com's definitions of computation, computing, calculate, and compute are circular, so it doesn't help. 

Wikipedia defines computation to be ""any type of calculation that follows a well-defined model."" 
It defines calculation as ""the deliberate process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more results, with variable change."" But it seems this definition includes many actions as computations even though they aren't typically thought of as computation. 

For example, wouldn't this entail that, say, a bomb exploding is a computation, with the input being the fuse being lighted and the output being the explosion?

So, what exactly is computation?
",Kelmikra,https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/24518,"This is the question that Turing set out to solve in his famous 1936 paper, On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem, a paper in which he comes up with (what came to be known as) the Turing machine model. See in particular Section 9.

Turing's work is in the context of computable numbers. There are other notions of computation appropriate for computing other kinds of structures, and their study forms part of computation theory (also known as recursion theory).

The main difference between the common notion of computation and your example (an exploding bomb) is the thing being computed. What is being computed by your exploding bomb? Another difference is the computational means, but one can envision a mechanical contraption which uses bombs to compute something more legitimate.

Another point is whether the classical notions of computation apply to what we perceive today as computation – namely, two-way interaction between the computer and the user. This is a common criticism levelled against the classical notional of computability, though interaction can be modelled using the tools of computation theory (it's just not what you learn in class).

If vacuum metalization is possible, would the reflective coating layer be durable enough to withstand the bending of a flexible plastic such as polyurethane or a thermoplastic elastomer, without cracking over time?
",MachuPichu,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/1150,"It might be possible to deposit a metallic film on a sheet of plastic. It is however, a problem with respect to the bonding of that layer. Depending on the plastic used, it might not have a strong bond with the metal, which would then over time develop defects.

On the other hand, it might be possible, when carefully manufacturing this, that the plastic has 'functional groups' (parts of the molecule with a specific function) that would bind a metal. Note however, that in this case, the functional groups might also react with other chemicals. Almost no functional group will only under go one reaction, especially not when metals are involved. Therefore, this would not be the most durable of options. Furthermore, because of the interface between, most likely, an amorphous solid (wikipedia, amorphous solids) and a metal structure is bound to create some defects.

A last option I can think of, is the use of conductive polymers. These polymers, because in many ways they mimic metals, also have a similar 'shininess' to them. However, I'm not sure about their really being a mirror. 

Hope this helped.

Don't want to change the server doc? That's okay, but conceptually a chat join isn't a chat message. So you should definitely have a meta field for stuff like this in your chat documents.

But supposing you don't want to do that. I'd do something like this:

var userIdToName = function(userId) {...}; // some kind of userId to name helper

Template.chatroom.msg = function() {
  var messages = Chat.findOne(Session.get(""currentChat"")).messages; // msg in your code?
  return _.reduce(messages,function (newMessages, currentMessage) {
    var lastMsg = newMessages[newMessages.length-1];
    if (currentMessage.type == MESSAGE_TYPES_JOIN) {
       if (lastMsg &amp;&amp; lastMsg.type == MESSAGE_TYPES_JOIN &amp;&amp; currentMessage.user == lastMsg.user) {
          currentMessage.timesJoined = lastMsg.timesJoined+1;
          newMessages.shift();
       } else {
          currentMessage.timesJoined = 1;
       }
       currentMessage.chatMsg = userIdToName(lastMsg.user) + "" joins the chat &amp;mult;"" + currentMessage.timesJoined.toString();
    }
    return newMessages.concat(currentMessage);
  },[]);
}


This is a bit of a doozy. Suffice it to say, it ""reduces"" all the join messages it finds in the chat's current messages down to one message. You dynamically add the property timesJoined; it does not appear in the document. But you should have a type field that lets you know the difference between a join message and a regular message is.

If you don't even have that metadata at minimum, then your chat application isn't going to work very well. Don't hesitate to change your model!

5393,Unity: Rolling a ball around a spherical planet with forces,"I'm trying to make a game in Unity where the player character is a ball (a sphere), and the game world is a planet (a very large sphere) that the ball can roll around on. The ball can be rolled in any direction, via the arrow keys. If the player holds the right arrow, the ball should roll smoothly to the right, all the way around the planet not leaving the ground, until it eventually reaches back to where it started. The camera follows the ball third person such that the ball always appears in the same position in the screen and the planet appears to be moving underneath it.

My question is, how can I use rigidbody.AddForce() to roll the ball in the way described above? What I think I need to do is to take the vector I get from taking the input values on the horizontal and vertical axes:

float moveX = Input.GetAxis (""Horizontal"");
float moveY = Input.GetAxis (""Vertical"");

Vector3 inputMovement = new Vector3 (moveX, 0.0f, moveY);


And rotate it somehow, so that I'm applying that vector as force to the ball but in the direction that's tangential to the point on the planet that the ball is currently on, and then apply it as force to the ball's rigidbody. So if you're looking at the planet head on, and the ball is at 3 o'clock, pressing the right arrow key should apply the force directly downwards.

Can anyone help me out here? I think it's probably really simple but I'm having trouble figuring it out exactly.

5776,Proportion of resources devoted to UX Design & Research vs. Software Development on a web app?,"First, some criteria:


The product is an application and is heavy on user interaction.  Think web 2.0 or mobile application, not a marketing or commerce site, or some back-end tool with only command-line access.
I realize that it is not always clear who is a UX person and who is a developer (nor should it be), so I'd like to focus on overall team resource allocation.  For instance, ""My team puts 25% of our resource-time into UX design/research vs. 75% of our resource-time in development.""  
I am not distinguishing between front-end and back-end development as it is too platform-specific and difficult to tease out the dividing like.  It's all software development for this question.
EDIT: Development is occurring in an agile-esque, ongoing manner, rather than a one-time, big-bang delivery.


So:


How does this proportion commonly look in practice?
How should it look?  Or, better yet, what has been the proportion on successful teams?


(I realize this is a classic ""it depends"" question, but I suspect that there is some use in asking when constrained by a few parameters, and allowing that conditions will vary.  I am also open to suggestions to further constrain the question.)
",peteorpeter,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/3916,"It's hard to draw a line between UX and Dev. There shouldn't be a line (as you state). It's going to depend on the project and the individual skill sets of the team. 

The bigger factor, IMHO, is that the team, as a whole, isn't too large. You want to avoid the 'too many cooks' syndrome which seems all-to-common at the enterprise level where you end up with dev teams pushing over 20 people. That's just a mess. 

You can do a lot with with just a team of 2: a skilled programmer and a skilled UX person who both have some skills that cross the line or, at least appreciate both sides of the equation. 

Maybe a better way to look at it is in reverse...what's a BAD team. I think a sign of a bad team make up is when there is a discernable line between UX and Dev. I'm suffering a bit through that situation right now, where our UX team is entirely independent of the dev team (which I am on)...which is entirely independent from the enterprise architecture team (who's applications services we rely on). Even though we call our selves an agile shop, it ends up being waterfall as there is this assembly line mentality UX -> Dev.

5204,Best way to organize models with multiple meshes and textures?,"I have character models which have different parts, ex: upper body, head, lower body; each part is a separate mesh in the same model. Each part has several textures associated with it (diffuse, normal, etc).

I'm wondering if there is a best practice for associating the textures with the meshes, given a .obj file as the model, for example, and .tga files for the textures.

So for instance, making sure the head textures get mapped on to the head object.

One way would be having a separate file for each mesh, and using the file names to associate them with their textures, but that seems impractical.

Is there a nice, clean way to do this, which is both easy to program (importing and rendering) and easy for the artist?
",cloudhead,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/8899,"Many typical source formats already do what you're asking for in data.  The format will contain a list of N materials and a list of M meshes with a mapping for each particular mesh to the material it uses.  Your converter can convert these directly to your in-engine format.

Other formats make use of external references, which is handy if you have multiple meshes that share materials.  The format is again usually the same: the format has a list of N material references and M meshes and maps each mesh to its material.

In engine, you would either use a reference/pointer/handle to each material for each mesh or use an ID system.  You load your optimized format which would likely use a reference system as in the previous paragraph.  When you load foo.model you'd get a hierarchy of M meshes each with an identiier of the material resource to load.  You load the material if not already loaded and attach the handle/id to the mesh.

For example, you might have the files:

/asset/material/stone.mat
/asset/material/steel.mat
/asset/model/gargoyle.model
/asset/model/gargoyle/face.mat
/asset/model/rock.model
/asset/model/sword.model


In such a setup, your gargoyle.mod might have 4 sub meshes using 3 materials, something like:

body =&gt; /asset/material/stone.mat
sword =&gt; /asset/material/steel.mat
armor =&gt; /asset/material/steel.mat
head =&gt; /asset/model/gargoyle/face.mat


This maps to a structure like:

materials: [0:stone, 1:steel, 2:face]
meshes: [0:(body, 0), 1:(sword, 1), 2:(armor, 1), 3:(head, 2)]


Your engine basically loads that data, loading any materials referenced that's it's missing.  Assuming you've already loaded a number of materials, the in-memory format would be similar to the above but with different IDs (mapping to in-memory structures and not the on-file structure):

materials: [..., 25:stone, ..., 57:steel, ..., 93:face, ...]
models: [..., gargoyle: [0:(body, 25), 1:(sword, 57), 2:(armor, 57), 3:(face, 93)], ...]


A library like Open Asset Importer makes writing your converters much easier given all the formats it supports.  You may need to modify it or branch out if your source format extensions (3d authoring plugins) get too advanced, though it does have a degree of flexibility.

2077,"What do you call a customer's customer in a specification document, use case, or scenario?","My team and I develop software that our customers will use to interact with their customers.  Additionally, we also eat our own dogfood and use the software ourselves to interact with our customers.

Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to explain use cases and scenarios, as our employees can be operators, our customers can be operators, and our customers' customers can be visitors.

However, our customers can also be visitors interacting with our operator employees, our customers' customers can be visitors interacting with our customer or our employee.

Here is a model where:

A is an employee
B is a customer
C is our customers' customer

X  interacts with  Y
Operator --&gt; Visitor
      A  --&gt;  B
      A  --&gt;  C
      B  --&gt;  C


Because sometimes our customers can play different roles, it's sometimes necessary to refer to the specific role, Operator or Visitor, instead of Employee and Customer.

It's also a mouthful to say ""customer's customer"" all the time.

I was wondering how other development shops handle these semantic details when writing their use cases and scenarios.  


Are there any one-word, generic terms that can apply to any product that involves a third-level actor?
Other than using the specific roles, Operator and Visitor, what words could be used to identify a customer of a customer?  


The word would need to be short enough as to be adopted within an organization.  If longer than a couple syllables, it's shortened form must still differentiate it from the other actors.
",jmort253,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/12611,"Maybe a bit of a tangent but...

I'm fond of interaction design myself, and there you never use abstract ""roles"" or ""users"" but something called ""personas"". Basically you make a up a character with a name, description and photograph and then you use that in your design process

""Bob is a bank manager in his middle years, he has some computer experience but is not especially fond of them.""

Then in your project you can use their real names ""No, Bob wouldn't want that"" , ""If Bob does this then Alice needs to be notified somehow"". Personas are especially useful when you're doing scenarios.

",Daniel,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/6471,"If you are indeed referring to your images having too much contrast to allow for both a properly exposed subject and sky, then there are a few options.


As Zak stated, you could use exposure compensation to darken the entire image (this might make the non-sky portion of the image too dark though)
Use a graduated neutral density filter. This will selectively darken one part of an image while leaving the other part alone. This is the old-school method. While it typically limits the transition between the filtered and unfiltered parts to a straight line, it does allow you to fix things at the time of the shot without having to spend time tweaking it on the computer afterwards.

4689,How did Adam and Eve win at Hide and Seek?,"I began reading the KJV a couple months ago, and one question that keeps plaguing my mind is, ""How did Adam and Eve successfully hide from God?""

Genesis Chapter 3:


  8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in
  the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the
  presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
  
  9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where [art]
  thou?
  
  10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
  because I [was] naked; and I hid myself.

",jay_t55,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/4268,"I like the Pulpit Commentary on this. It says that God called Adam because God wanted to bring him to confession.


  Adam's absence was a clear proof
  that something was wrong. Hitherto he had always welcomed the Divine
  approach. ""And said unto him, Where art thou?"" Not as if ignorant of
  Adam's hiding-place, but to bring him to confession.


You can't play a hide-and-seek game with God (Hebrews 4:13) because He is omnipresent(Psalm 139:8). God demanded confession from Adam. God also wanted to continue the fellowship even though Adam tried to avoid Him. God was seeking Adam because God still loved him despite his disobedience . God wanted to help Adam and Eve on how to cover their nakedness. Not yet skilled or aware of how to make garments, they tried to cover themselves in vain. God helped them by providing garments of animal skin. 

Where art thou? God is always calling us to repent and come to Him. It is our responsibility to response to His call and confess all our sins.


  Revelation 3:20 (NKJV) Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If
  anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and

Instructions are for a simple ""one store"" website where the ""default store view"" is set to inherit its setup from the ""default config"". There will be an additional instance of the below mentioned table rows for each unchecked Use Website checkbox.


Open your core_config_data table in phpMyAdmin.
Sort table by path column and find the following rows for your unsecure section, they should look like the following:


Columns

PATH                         VALUE
web/unsecure/base_url        http://www.mydomain.com/

web/unsecure/base_media_url  {{unsecure_base_url}}media/
web/unsecure/base_js_url     {{unsecure_base_url}}js/



Replace http://www.mydomain.com/ with your appropriate domain url (trailing slash necessary) and if you’ve installed in a subfolder append it with a / after it.

Clear contents from var/cache, var/session directories after changing base_urls.


Clearing cache and sessions is necessary because your config is cached and clearing it forces a reread of the configuration data from the core_config_data table and reestablishment of sessions with the proper information.

NOTE: If you have set your base_url correctly for web/unsecure/base_url and web/secure/base_url you do not have to mess around with changing the {{UNSECURE_BASE_URL}} and {{SECURE_BASE_URL}} macros in the rest of the entries.

How to change base_url settings with mysql from the command line


Log into your MySQL database, replace $USER with your database user name and $DBASE with your database name. It will prompt you for your password:


mysql -u $USER -p $DBASE


Below are the SQL commands to change your base_url values. Replace unsecure http://www.mydomain.com/ and secure https://www.mydomain.com/ (if you have SSL/TLS enabled, else https should be http) with your appropriate domain url (trailing slash necessary) and if you’ve installed in a subfolder append it with a / after it.


SQL Commands

UPDATE core_config_data SET value = 'http://www.example.com/' WHERE path LIKE 'web/unsecure/base_url';
UPDATE core_config_data SET value = 'https://www.example.com/' WHERE path LIKE 'web/secure/base_url';



Check your base_url settings with the following:


SQL Commands

SELECT path,value FROM core_config_data WHERE path LIKE 'web/unsecure/base%';
SELECT path,value FROM core_config_data WHERE path LIKE 'web/secure/base%';&lt;/code&gt;

1156,How to determine directions of vectors of an electromagnetic wave,"I did an exercise which probably is quite popular,
in which you draw an electromagnetic wave and prove that it should
propagate at the speed of light $1 \over \sqrt {\mu_0\epsilon_0}$ using Farday's law and Ampere's law.

Basically if this is the wave: 




Let's say the E-field (red) is in the X direction, the B-Field (blue) is in the Y direction,
and the velocity of the wave is in the Z direction.

You take for example for ampere's law a surface in the ZY plane with a length L
equal to the amplitude of the wave,
and a width equal to $\lambda\over 4$
You do a similar thing with Faraday's law and you get the speed of light,
assuming you know that the E-field and B-field propagate in this manner.

I got the right answer but I wondered about this:
Let's say I only had the E-field and I know the wave propagates at the speed of light, I assume this is enough information to draw the B-field at each point.

But how will I know the direction? Both Faraday's law and Ampere's law say you need a closed loop integral and the rules I've been taught say
you go over the loop in a clockwise direction for example and take the 
normal to the surface according to the right hand rule etc.

But clockwise and counter-clockwise direction don't really give me much information in this case, so how can I determine the direction of the B-field
if I only have the E-field?

However, all what is printed out are the words ""Array"".
(I have enabled the PHP input filter for the body field).

Note: in the posted code, I have also tried substituting 'views' with various items such as ""block"". I have used 'handy_tips-block_1' as the ID, because that is what is displayed on the configuration link of the block administration page.

About display a View, you can use this line of code inside your template, to call a view:

echo views_embed_view('view-name', $display_id = 'display-name');


for example, inside my node.tl.php I want to insert a view called test view and I want to use his Block display with machine name block_test, then I can use:

",Steven Jeuris,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/10877,"Each of the ships in Wipeout HD is balanced differently.  There are some that are clearly inferior (ie, the overall total of their stats is lower than other ships) but they balance that by having best-in-class performance in a certain area.  Depending on the track, they might outperform a ship with overall better stats, simply because they focus on an area important to the track.

Your play style (and strengths/weaknesses) factor into this as well.  If you're good in a straight shot, but terrible in turns, you may want to pick a ship with better handling, for instance.

This guide lists all of the ships and their respective stats (including the unlockable ships) so that you can determine which one you like best.

The Fury expansion pack unlocked a new set of ships with better stats - these ships are categorically better than their 'standard' variants.  There's no reason to use the 'standard' ships if you have the Fury expansion.

Skins are unlocked for completing certain challenges, and they factor into achievements, but there's not much else that they do besides that and showing off your Wipeout HD skills to other players online..

The use of the webfont is properly specified in the CSS with correct URL pointing to a .woff file hosted in the server that runs the site.

I clear the cache.

I load the home page, everything is fine.

I load a second page, the page doesn't load.

Inspecting the network activity it comes out that Safari has loaded every resource except the webfont;

it is aware the webfont is in cache, doesn't attemp to reload (no request is sent to the server) but is stuck processing that resource (the spinner keeps spinning).

Reloading the (second) page, results in getting the page loaded just fine.

Other browsers behave with no issues.

Is this a bug in Safari or I'm missing something? Is there any workaround?

Here is the CSS:

@font-face {
    font-family: 'myfont';
    src: url( '../font/my-font-webfont.eot' );
    src: url( '../font/my-font-webfont.eot?#iefix' ) format( 'embedded-opentype' ),

1583,Is hacking back a valid security technique for companies?,"Recently it has come to light through the reverse engineering of hacking tools that there are vulnerabilities in them that could be exploited to take over an attackers computer during a remote hacking session. In other words, while they are hacking you, you could get into the system from which they are launching the attack to find out what they have managed to access, what the system is, or even p4wn it yourself. The goals would be damage control, deterrence, and ultimately being able to charge the perpetrator of the crime. 

Leaving aside the many legal, ethical, and moral considerations (if you are curious there's a debate recorded here), my question is whether hacking back using this technique has any value to a company. If it was ethical and legal would it be worth a company to invest in the systems and skills needed to make this work, or is it a waste of money? 

EDIT:
There's been several comments regarding leaving the legal and ethical considerations out of the question, so here's the explanation behind that. So far the discussion of hacking back in this manner has been discussed by lawyers, some shouting it is legal, and others saying it isn't. What they do agree on is that there's no case law, and until there is there will be no clear answer. Also, legalities vary from nation to nation, so the answer to legality is ""maybe"" and ""it depends where you are"". 

However so far none of the discussion I've seen has been among IT Security professionals who would be the ones to design, deploy, and run systems that would to the hacking back. The lawyers all seem to think that organizations would adopt the technique as a matter of course, but I am not in agreement with that and I would like to hear the views of my peers. This is why I've asked the question apart from legal and ethical aspects.

4795,SQL Server 2000 - 'Performance: Deadlock',"We had to restart our SQL Server today, we had made no changes to it.

When it came back up we immediately started getting this error from the server


  DATE/TIME:    2/27/2014 3:09:31 PM
  
  DESCRIPTION:  The SQL Server performance counter 'Number of
  Deadlocks/sec' (instance 'Database') of object 'SQLServer:Locks' is
  now above the threshold of 1.00 (the current value is 2.00).
  
  COMMENT:  (None)
  
  JOB RUN:  (None)


We ran the DBCC TRACEON (1204) command and have watched the log's but it's not reporting any deadlocks.

Any idea what could trigger this to just go off? We are getting the alert every minute yet can't find any actual deadlocks.

Edit: I should add that before this reboot we had never received this error

Edit 2: We used SQL Server Profiler as well to look for deadlocks, let it run for 5 minutes over which we received 5 error alerts and when we checked the details we had NO deadlocks found.

Edit 3: March 06/2014: Ran the query and it worked, but it reports what our other details have said that we have no locks we where still getting the error above the whole time.

Thanks again for all your help!



Edit 4: March 06/2014: I ran the query and here is a sampling of the result set, I will admit I am not exactly sure what I am looking at here, that is to say I am not sure if it shows me something that I can act on or not.



Edit 5: March 07/2014: Image below shows the Alert that generates this error all of a sudden.

",Stephen Archbold,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/35059,"While this counter says /sec, I believe it is a cumulative counter. If I'm right, this means you have had a TOTAL of 2 deadlocks since the service has been up.

I'm not at a machine where I can test this, but I suspect that if you simulate your own deadlock - once - you'll suddenly be getting 3.0 deadlocks ""per second"" until another deadlock occurs or you restart the service. 

There are many scripts out there that will help you force a deadlock, basically:

-- window 1

Create table dbo.x(a int); create table dbo.y(b int);

Insert dbo.x(a) select 1: insert dbo.y select 2;

Begin transaction;

Update dbo.x set a = a + 1; 

-- window 2

Begin transaction;
Update dbo.y set b = b + 1;
Update dbo.x set a = 5;

-- go back to window 1

Update dbo.y set b = 22;


Now, if the counter goes up to 3.0, you know what to do: go find that pesky alert and disable it, or keep getting the alert but become desensitized to it unless the number changes drastically.

6001,How has sneaking changed from 3.5 to Pathfinder?,"Was researching this in order to answer How can a Shadowdancer use spring attack with Hide in Plain Sight? I learned a fair amount about these changes and since they&rsquo;re pretty significant, I wanted to write it down.

How have the rules regarding sneaking around changed from Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 to Pathfinder?
",KRyan,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/4563,"Skill Consolidation

Hide and Move Silently are now one skill, Stealth. A nice perk for rogues; a nicer perk for those who don&rsquo;t have 8+Int skill points and still want to be sneaky. Also very nice that it&rsquo;s only one roll: less chance of rolling very low and messing up your attempt to sneak. Or, if you do roll high, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about having a mediocre roll on the other.

On the flip side, Spot and Listen have also been consolidated into one skill, Perception. This is still to your benefit when you&rsquo;re sneaking, though, since it means those trying to find you only get to roll one check; there&rsquo;s less chance of an abnormally high roll.

Changes to the effect of Hiding

In 3.5, the effect of hiding was left vague until Rules Compendium. Thankfully, Rules Compendium clarified some things, including the fact that those who fail their Spot check treat you the same way they treat invisible creatures, which means they are flat-footed with respect to you. This is important because that&rsquo;s one of the conditions that qualifies for Sneak Attack.

In Pathfinder, not so much: a successful Stealth check gets you Concealment. In most cases, this is basically useless because you usually need Concealment to use Stealth in the first place. That is, Stealth is often literally giving you what you already had. You can use Stealth with Cover instead of Concealment, in which case you get both, but Cover is much more difficult to manufacture, which makes it much less reliable.

With Hide in Plain Sight, you can give yourself Concealment when you wouldn&rsquo;t have had it. That&rsquo;s nice, but the costs of getting Hide in Plain Sight are very high, and Concealment just isn&rsquo;t that good. All Concealment does is give attackers a 20% chance to miss you. It does not improve your attack or damage in any way. Notably, Concealment is insufficient to trigger Sneak Attack.

Changes to triggering Sneak Attack

On the plus side, constructs, plants, and undead are no longer immune to Sneak Attack. Elementals and oozes still are, as are the new proteans, and things with the incorporeal subtype are immune unless you have Ghost Touch. The 3.5 rogue could overcome these limitations, but it was tricky (required particular wands or feats or ACFs, and often still only did half damage), so this is good.

The good news ends there. As stated, Stealth cannot trigger Sneak Attack. Nor can grease in most cases (and the rules are ambiguous about the cases where it would work), and the blink spell is right-out. Alchemical weapons no longer work either, which is a shame for low-level rogues. Marbles no longer exist. That means a lot of the ways for a solo rogue to generate the conditions required to get Sneak Attack are gone.

As such, you are either going to have to ignore the &ldquo;Sneak&rdquo; aspect of Sneak Attack entirely (and just use Flanking to trigger it), or you&rsquo;re going to need magic, preferably greater invisibility. Rogues get Use Magic Device, but that&rsquo;s an expensive wand.

6626,Circuit to control a impulse solenoid valve from a movement detector,"I have a movement detector sensor that generate a pulse (3.3V TTL) for 60 seconds when something moves in front of it. On the other hand, I have a impulse solenoid valve that close on a negative voltage (-3.6V) and open on a positive voltage (+3.6V).

What would be the simplest and cheapest way to drive the solenoid from the movement detector?

The circuit or chip should produce +3.6V output for at least 30ms when the input signal goes to 3.3V and then produce -3.6V for at least 30ms when the input signal goes low (0V).

(I also have available a solenoid that work on 4.5V rather than 3.6V if this can help)

24/08/2013 Update

Inspired by the answer of Jim, will a circuit like this one work?


",Pat,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/27887,"Normally I wouldn't do a bespoke design (especially for free) but this problem has a lot of common themes with other questions being asked so I thought it would be a good exercise to go through it in the hope that my solution (or parts of it) could be used elsewhere. Apologies for its length. MOSFET types should be able to switch a few amps and be of the 'digital' type (low gate turn on voltages).

Problems:

(1) the solenoid valve requires a positive pulse and a negative pulse (of about 30mS) to open an close it. 

(2) the sensor outputs a single pulse of about 60 seconds.

(3) the Pump requires a 3v6 pulse at about 500mA

Assumptions:

(1) the pump valve stays ON or OFF depending on the last pulse

(2) You want to turn the valve ON at the beginning of the sensor pulse and OFF at the end.

I noticed the valve has only two wires so rather than positive and negative pulses its more reversing current direction. For a single supply that would suggest some form of changeover switch or an H bridge. I chose to go with a MOSFET H bridge and worked out from there.

The circuit:



THE H BRIDGE: Q3,Q4,Q5,Q6

MOSFETs Q3,Q4,Q5,Q6 and Diodes D1,D2,D3 and D4 form a fairly conventional H Bridge using P channel MOSFETS at the top and N channel at the bottom. IC1d is a CMOS schmitt inverter gate that switches the opposite sides of the bridge. A LOW on the gate turns  Q3 ON  and turns Q4 OFF. The inverter output (HIGH) turns ON Q6  and turns Q5 OFF. Current direction will be left to right through the valve (current forward). 

A HIGH on the Q4 MOSFET gate turns it Q4 ON but turns Q3 OFF . The output from the inverter (LOW) turns Q5 ON and turns Q6 OFF. The output current direction is now right to left. (Current reversed).

CURRENT PULSE POWER CONTROL: (Q1,Q2)

If the H bridge was powered all the time the valve would burn out. 

Q1 is normally held OFF by R1. This part of the circuit only allows the H Bridge to work when it is Q1 is turned ON. 

When the gate of Q2 is taken HIGH by the 30mS pulse it switches ON and pulls the gate of Q1 to ground, turning it ON as well. When the pulse returns to LOW it is turned OFF

TIMING CIRCUIT: (R3,C1, IC1b, IC1c and IC2a)

I could have used a simple 8 pin micro-controller for this section but chose to do it with with a few simple logic gates.

IC1a acts simply as an inverting buffer taking the 60 second pulse at its input. 

One of the inputs to the XOR gate is taken through a simple RC delay circuit (R3, C1). When there is a change in the state (HIGH-> LOW or LOW->HIGH) of the incoming pulse this RC delay will cause the output of the XOR gate to go HIGH for the delay period. (Dual edge triggered monostable)

Eventually the two inputs of the gate will be the same and then the output of the gate will go LOW. In other words we get a pulse after the rising AND falling edges of the input signal (frequency doubler). If we set this delay pulse to be about 30mS it is exactly what we require for the input to Q1,Q2.  

The direction of the current passing through the bridge is controlled by the input signal as it will be HIGH (detected) or LOW (timed out) at the time of the pulse.

",Pinoniq,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/26276,"Overall, I'd say recursion is a good way to go. Good use of an IIFE to keep things tidy as well. I do however have some concerns.

Input checking

Firstly, if I pass an empty array, I get a stack overflow, since you only check for a length of 1 - not for a length &lt; 1. I am technically passing the correct type (an array) to the function, so it should handle it (if I pass something that's not an array, then it's my own fault).

Also, if I pass [9] (or [31415]) I just get undefined back, though an empty array would probably be more fitting.

shift() is destructive

Be careful with shift()! You're modifying the array that's been passed to the function, even though it doesn't really ""belong to you"". The caller might still have a use for it.

For instance,

var numbers = [1, 2, 3];
var words = keypadPossibilities(numbers);
console.log(""You typed "" + numbers.length + "" digits, producing "" + words.length + "" possible words"");


will print

You typed 0 digits, producing 27 possible words

Wait, zero digits? Thing is, numbers is suddenly empty; everything's been shifted out by passing it to keypadPossibilities.

This of course also happens when the function recurses, which could spell trouble. Luckily, in your case, you don't use the input array for anything after having recursed, but if you did you'd find that the recursion had truncated it down to empty.

Don't use for...in for arrays

for...in will iterate properties of an object, and with no guaranteed order. It usually works for arrays, but it's not a sure thing. It's semantically different from iterating the actual, indexed elements in the array. So use either a regular ol' for loop, or - if you're targeting modern runtimes, maybe a forEach().

However, you could also use map() and reduce() in this case (see below).

Other stuff

This function-wrapper around a call to getPosibilities is unnecessary:

return function(pressed_keys)
{
    return getPosibilities(pressed_keys);
}


(Oh, and there's a typo: getPosibilities is missing an extra ""s"". I'll just use the corrected name from hereon out)

You could simply replace the above with just:

return getPossibilities;


and done.

However, with the point about shift() in mind, the easiest thing to do would probably be something like

return function(pressed_keys)
{
    return getPossibilities(pressed_keys.slice());
}


Now, pressed_keys gets sliced (duplicated) before it's passed to getPossibilities.

You could also do the slicing in getPossibilities (and do the direct return, shown above), but - as the code's already proved - you don't really need it there. But in the interest of being thorough, it'd look something like:

var currentIndex = keypad_mapping_indexes[0]
// ... snip ...
var charactersToGlueAtEnd = getPossibilities(digits.slice(1)); // duplicate array from index 1 and up


A few notes on style

In terms of style, I'm not a fan of brace-on-new-line in JavaScript. Yes, it works, but it can bite you, since JS will sometimes do automatic semicolon insertion at newlines and break your code. So the convention is to use brace-on-same-line style.

Also by convention, all names in JS should be camelCase. You're using a bit of both; aim for consistency.



Here's a possible version incorporating the points above

var keypadPossibilities = (function() {
  var keypadMapping = [
    null,
    ['a','b','c'],
    ['d','e','f'],
    ['g','h','i'],
    ['j','k','l'],
    ['m','n','o'],
    ['p','q','r','s'],
    ['t','u','v'],
    ['w','x','y','z']
  ];

  function getPossibilities(digits) {
    var characters = keypadMapping[digits.shift()],
        charactersToGlueAtEnd;

    if(!digits.length) {
      return characters || [];
    }

    charactersToGlueAtEnd = getPossibilities(digits);

    return characters.reduce(function (memo, character) {
      var words = charactersToGlueAtEnd.map(function (string) { return character + string; });
      return memo.concat(words);
    }, []);
  }

  return function (digits) {
    return getPossibilities(digits.slice()); // make sure we work on a copy of the input array
  };
})();

2875,Why can't the compiler infer this type argument from usage,"This question is based off of the results from another SO question of mine. My new question is not a question of how can I get X to work, but why doesn't X work.

I've created a simplified example of my problem, however if you want to see the practical application/situation I'm using this, look at my original question (the below functions don't actually do anything useful).

T bar&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;T, bool&gt; f) { return default(T); }
bool foo(int i) { return true; }


Now I have 3 lines of code that do work as expected and all do the same thing purpose wise.

int num;
num = bar&lt;int&gt;(foo);
num = bar(new Func&lt;int, bool&gt;(foo));
num = bar((int i) =&gt; true );


My question is ""Why do I need to explicitly specify T for bar for the first example?"" The reason I wonder this is because the compiler turns the first two examples into the same line of code. Using ILSpy I see that the code compiles to this.

num = Program.bar&lt;int&gt;(new Func&lt;int, bool&gt;(Program.foo));
num = Program.bar&lt;int&gt;(new Func&lt;int, bool&gt;(Program.foo));
num = Program.bar&lt;int&gt;((int i) =&gt; true);


I don't understand why the compiler can't infer the type from the fact that I only have one function called foo, and it does fit the template so to speak. Now if I had created another function bool foo(bool i) I would understand if the compiler complained that there was some ambiguity and it didn't know which one I wanted and that I should specify the type argument explicitly.

This of course is just me being lazy, but it is just something I was expecting and was surprised when the compiler wasn't picking up my slack.
",BenVlodgi,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1812944,"I'm on the bus, so, short answer.

type inference of t requires knowing the formal parameter type of the delegate type in the argument.

conversion of the method group to the delegate type does overload resolution as though the method group was invoked with the arguments of the formal parameter types of the target delegate.

but those types are what we are trying to deduce!

this is circular reasoning, so type inference rejects it. A method group conversion requires that the formal parameter types be deduced from some other argument.

you have no other arguments.

so inference fails.

that the group contains only one method is irrelevant. It would be bizarre if adding more methods to the group caused inference to fail. The rule that a group of overloads is resolved through overload resolution is a sensible one, and that requires knowing the parameters. You don't get to run the inferences backwards just because a method group happens to be a singleton.

see the type inference tag on my msdn blog for a longer article on this topic.

{
    @Html.Partial(""_SomePrice"", item)

2516,Dealing with digital circuits and their associated switching speed?,"When designing a digital one-minute counting circuit I came across a difficult problem. 

Basically, I designed the circuit to drive the (normally HIGH) clock of the 10s slot low if the 1s slot's current state was 9 (actually, just if the first and last bits are HIGH -> 1001)

The devices I am using are positive edge, so when the 1s slot returns to zero the condition is no longer satisfied - therefore the clock returns to a HIGH state and increments the 10s slot.

The problem is that I was getting double clock problems(7->8 transition and the designed clock mechanism).   

It turns out that there was just enough delay in the switching between 7 -> 8 (0111 -> 1000) that the first/last bit HIGH condition is satisfied:

i.e., some combination occurs in the transition period to register a logical HIGH at the output

1001 1011 1101 1111

The temporary solution to the problem I came up with was to actually keep the clock for the 10s slot LOW until the condition where the 1s slot equals 0 (0000) is satisfied(So, essentially clock WHEN we get to the state as opposed to before). However, this solution requires too many gates (a 4-input NOR minimum). My previous design was actually fed from another part in the design that is already present, so it didn't require any additional circuitry. 

Any ideas on a more efficient solution?  




The IC's used in this design are the 74LS47 (7Segment decoder) and the 74LS163 (4-bit binary counter). The pull-down resistor inclusion is a mechanism to set the counters to 00 and hold while the switch is closed. 
",sherrellbc,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/26864,"If you're having problems with switching speed on a slow switching circuit, the simplest solution is to slow it down.  I would suggest using your original idea, but add a series RC lowpass filter (series R, then shunt C to GND) right before the clock input pin with a time constant (R times C) on the order of a milisecond or so.  This should filter out any very short runt pulses that are being generated.  If that doesn't work, crank up the time constant to 10 ms or even 100 ms.  Too high and there will be a noticable delay, though.

Unfortunately, instead of the photo album protecting the pictures, the plastic coverings yellowed, and the pictures themselves had to be carefully extracted from the books. There is also quite a bit of powdered paper (the backings on the books pretty much fell apart while we extracted the pictures), and the fronts of the images are still a bit sticky.

These pictures are 30+ years old, are often extremely faded, and were originally taken on (what I think is) ""110 film"" -- they are approximately 2.5"" squares.

Anyway, I need to scan all these images in to preserve them from further decay. Unfortunately, it's taking forever -- going through less than 100 images took an entire day, even if one discounts any time spent in Photoshop trying to remove some of the photo album's artifacts on the images.

What I really need is some method of scanning the images in faster. Most automated solutions aren't going to work because they accept 4x6s as their smallest image size, and even if that was not the case, the adhesives still stuck to the prints would probably ruin any such device in 5 seconds flat.

  Can we completely reverse-engineer the source code from java bytecode ?


Not completely, because some aspects of source code, such as whitespace, local variable names, and comments, are not preserved in bytecode. Otherwise, yes -- while you can't get the exact same source code out, you can almost always get something that can at least be compiled back to the same bytecode.


  Why this feature is allowed in Java


It's not so much ""allowed"" as it is ""not prevented"". And it's not prevented because doing so is impossible -- the code must be runnable to be useful; if the code is runnable, then it is analyzable; if it is analyzable, then with sufficient analysis it can be converted back to source.


  How successful are java decompilers against obfuscators?


Not very. Most obfuscators I've seen (esp. ProGuard) are primarily effective in removing meaningful function and class names; obfuscating the logic itself is not typically attempted.

I know that the radio waves are modulated to encode data and the frequency or amplitude are changed, so then the waves are propagated through the air and received at another location via a receiver that is tuned to a certain frequency that the waves were emitted, but I'm sure in most places in the world by now there are numerous amounts of waves traversing at any point, why doesn't the receiver of this device happen to catch another wave of the same frequency instead of the one that was intended? or is there anything that stops me from having a device that emits a wide range of frequencies or amplitudes that would manipulate nearby electronics?
",AlanZ2223,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/51988,"Radio wave receivers are designed to resonate at a particular frequency. If you look at the response of a resonant device as a function of frequency you get something like (this image is from the Wikipedia article):



This is a rather busy plot, but the point to take away is that the response of the resonant system is greatest when the frequency matches the resonant frequency. The more resonant the system is (the higher its Q factor) the more sharply peaked the response is.

So if you want your radio to pick up just 98.4MHz (the frequency of the radio station I'm listening to at the moment) you tune your receiver to resonate at 98.4MHz. It will still pick up other radio frequencies as well, but because of the resonance it's far more sensitive to the resonant frequency than to the other frequencies.

1743,"Learning how to be a good rhythm guitarist before becoming a lead guitarist, where to start?","I have recently been trying to hone in my improvisational skills. I'm stuck in the first position of the Am pentatonic box and can't move away from it. Whenever I try to move out of it, I randomize the next box that I go to, which most of the time leads to bad sounding improvisations.

I have narrowed the problem down to it being me having a bad sense of rhythm. I think I've got technique as a rhythm guitarist, but in regards to musicality, I don't. 

I don't know which chords go together well, what goes after a chord, how minors, majors and 7ths are formed (don't know if this is important to be a good rhythm guitarist though), etc.
",reverb,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/6204,"I'm addressing only your first paragraph. Assuming you want to stay pentatonic for now, and know the box in A based around the 5th to 8th frets, this should help. The box below that has basically two notes per string, as the box you know. Each higher note on each string is the SAME note as the lower one in your known box.So you already know HALF of it !!  Guess what - the next box up uses for its bottom notes the same ones as the TOP notes of your known box. Thus you already know HALF of that one !!  So - in order to use all three boxes, you only need to replicate the pentatonic notes around frets 2/3  and frets 7/10. If you start the higher box on 6th string, 8th fret, and use the Am pent. notes, you'll hopefully realise that it's actually C maj. pent. you're playing. It happens to use EXACTLY the same 5 notes, so you can solo along regardless.

262,Is Start & Stop technology good or bad for my car? (Alfa MiTO),"I was recently in the lucky position to obtain an (almost brand new) Alfa Romeo MiTo, Progression. Like many new cars coming out these days, it has ""Start &amp; Stop"" technology that turns the engine off when the car is stationary and is put in neutral and the clutch is released. When putting down the clutch again the engine fires back up.

My question then is this: 

a) Is start-stop technology bad for my engine in any way? 

b) What impact might start-stop have on my battery? I.e. won't it deteriorate battery life with the constant turning on and off? (The radio, fans and lights remain on whilst in ""stop""-mode, but not things like the aircon.)

c) Will this technology really benefit me that much with regards to fuel-consumption? I can imagine it will be more economic when stops in heavy traffic become really long or traffic lights are red for long periods, but for the most part when driving the car doesn't turn off for longer than a minute at most before I have to ""start"" it up again.

As many new cars lately have this technology I imagine that it can't be that bad, but I'm curious as to it's actual real benefits. I can turn this feature off, but I have to do so every time I start my car up for the first time and then I'm stuck with this glaring orange light in my dash, letting me know it's turned off.
",DeVil,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/538,"Potential savings from reduced idling should greatly outweigh any increased wear and tear on starting and charging systems. I answered similar question about idling before (Is idling bad for your engine?). To summarise the negative effects of idling:


Fuel combustion is incomplete, which leads to contamination of combustion chamber (glazing), spark plugs (wich reduces their effectiveness), exhaust system (including catalytic converter).
Motor does not operate at optimal temperature, which leads to excessive condensation of water vapour in exhaust system, which leads to its corrosion (ergo premature replacement), and increased emissions.


At the same time cost of wear and tear is low (American governmental agencies routinely cite $10 added per year). Roughly, it means if one would expect to replace the starter at 10–12 years normally, now one would do it at 8–10 (I pulled these numbers out of me arse, but they seem reasonable).

To quantify fuel savings we need to consider savings from reduced idling, and savings from avoided performance losses. Research paper from Vanderbilt University (Amanda R. Carrico et al, “Costly myths: An analysis of idling beliefs and behavior in personal motor vehicles.”) based on the survey of 1300 U.S. residents estimates that on average Americans spend about 16 minutes a day idling (4 minutes warming, 4 minutes waiting, 8 minutes in traffic). Possibly, in more compact European or South African municipalities these numbers could be lower.

Let us say we cut American number by about 60% and save around 6 minutes a day. 2.0L 4-cylinder petrol engine burns around 1 litre per hour idling. 6 × 365 / 60 = 36.5 hours/year, or 36.5 litres/year.

Reduced efficiency can cost even more. If a car is driven 1500 km (930 miles) a month or 18000 km (11100 miles) a year, and consumes on average 9L/100 km (2.0L compact), 5% reduction in efficiency leads to 0.05 (18000 / 100 × 9) = 81 litres per year extra.

So average Golf-class 2.0L 4-cylinder compact can consume extra ~120 litres (31 U.S. gallons) every year due to excessive idling. Multiply that by the price of petrol, and see potential savings on the fuel alone.

831,Are there any disadvantages to encrypting the password hash?,"Is encrypting the password hash in database more secure than storing only the hash?

Suppose we store encrypted SHA-256 result with AES instead of hash directly. Is this a good protection from a situation in the future when someone will break one of the algorithms?
",Piotr Müller,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/61366,"Bob Brown has covered most of the salient points in his answer but I did want to point out that there is one significant disadvantage:  Complexity.   You are increasing the complexity of your application to some degree, lesser (in the case of adding a pepper to the hash where you need to think about key management as well as storage of password hashes and salts) or greater (in the case of implementing something more sophisticated like AES and needing to store IVs or Nonces and possibly tags/MACs as well as the output, the salt, and managing the key(s).) 

So, is the value you're going to add sufficient to justify the additional cost of complexity?  You'll have to answer that question for your application.  I'd would say that it generally doesn't, while there certainly are cases out there where it does.   

In any case, as Bob mentioned, you need to start with a strong foundation and move to a better hashing algorithm like Bcrypt regardless of whether you decide to encrypt or not.

I wanted to take advantage of the fact the lists were sorted, but I fear my efforts only served to render my code convoluted and inefficient. What do you think?
",Legato,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/49181,"The following is more applicable assuming the exclusion of duplicates, which I note since as @SimonAndreForsberg says it isn't obvious, and none of the input tests used even include duplicates, so there's no way to know for sure.

Java Collection have a retainAll method. I hadn't used it before, but noticing its application to this problem led to:


Altering toIntArray to convert a string array toIntSet implementing LinkedHashSet to preserve order
Simply calling retainAll when finding intersection. 


The result: 

private static String findIntersection(Set&lt;Integer&gt; a, Set&lt;Integer&gt; b) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        a.retainAll(b);

        for (int n : a) {
            result.append(',').append(n);
        }

        return result.length() == 0 ? """" : result.toString().substring(1);
    }

private static Set&lt;Integer&gt; toIntSet(String[] array) {
    Set&lt;Integer&gt; nums = new LinkedHashSet&lt;&gt;();

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {
        nums.add(Integer.parseInt(array[i]));
    }

    return nums;
}


This suffers no edge-case bugs unlike the originally posted code, but what I realized is retainAll is painfully inefficient.

So, I began to redesign it accounting for the fact that numbers are sorted and I'm preserving such, but then @janos posted his answer, his answer coupled with the fact that none of the input cases contained negative integers led to this: 

private static String findIntersection(String[] arr1, String[] arr2) {
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    int val1 = Integer.parseInt(arr1[0]);
    int val2 = Integer.parseInt(arr2[0]);

    for (int i = 0, j = 0; val1 != -1 &amp;&amp; val2 != -1; ) {

        if (val1 == val2) {
            result.append(',').append(val1);
            val1 = ++i &lt; arr1.length ? Integer.parseInt(arr1[i]) : -1;
            val2 = ++j &lt; arr2.length ? Integer.parseInt(arr2[j]) : -1;
        } else if (val1 &lt; val2) {
            val1 = ++i &lt; arr1.length ? Integer.parseInt(arr1[i]) : -1;
        } else {
            val2 = ++j &lt; arr2.length ? Integer.parseInt(arr2[j]) : -1;
        }
    }

    return result.length() == 0 ? """" : result.substring(1);
}


Which foregoes the disadvantage of his suggestion. It's a unique case that allows this to work, but is applicable elsewhere for Objects and using null

2113,Doctors working on Shabbat,"What are some general guidelines regarding the halakhic permissibility for Jewish doctors to work on Shabbat?  I know that saving lives generally overrides Shabbat, but I am curious about less black-and-white situations that may occur on Shabbat, such as having a shift where one must be in the hospital or be on call, receiving medical training, etc.  Also, in a practical halakhic sense, are there any situations in which the appropriateness of violating Shabbat would depend on whether the patients are Jewish?  I'm sure that these are not simple questions and that there are likely multiple opinions on various issues, but some insight into this topic would be welcome.
",Sam,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/9,"First of all, being a doctor and healing the sick is not considered a Malacha (work on Shabbos). It is considered a Chachma, a gift, not a trade. See Rambam Hichos Refuah.

There is a fantastic Steera (contradiction) found in the Rambam which points this out. In Hilchos Shabbos, the Rambam holds that one is prohibited from carrying an amulet, since (medically speaking) they are of no use. However, in Hilchos Refuah, Rambam states that one can use (carry) an amulet since the ill person believes in this amulet (an amulet must be considered Mumcha, one which has been proven by healing the sick already), and healing is 60% in the mind, therefore the ill will be healed. As you can hear, the Rambam didn't sound like he was in favor of using tricks or the like. But if it works, any port in the storm!

Next question, is one allowed to transgress the Shabbos to heal a Goy? Technically no. However the Chachamim stressed that if they knew this they would kill us, therefore it is in our best interest to heal them (""משום איבה""). I fear to add this but Halacha is just that.

So, can one heal an animal on Shabbos? Basically no. However, one can make the animal comfortable until a doctor can administer to the animal. There is a wonderful book Sefer Tsar Balay Chaim by R' Itchak Nachman Eshkoli written in the last 10 years which deals with anything &amp; everything to do with animal suffering. My son-in-law used this while writing a paper on Feeding Animals on Shabbos while in YU. I highly recommend this sefer to anyone who has an animal, especially since Tzar Balay Chaim is a Torah Issur and it is important to know what one can or shouldn't do.

Medical Halacha is well researched by the likes of Dr. Fred Rosner, Rabbi Dr. Abraham S Abraham (Nishmas Avraham), and many more. There are many Rabbis who write on medical halacha. Although that is a subject for another time indeed!

4917,does re-encrypting the same value with multiple keys reduce security,"I found myself wondering today, how much security is lost if you take a plaintext - assume that its content, including any metadata is unknown to an attacker, for example it may be random data - and encrypt it with multiple keys (not chained) and give all resulting ciphertexts to an attacker, how much higher is the probability of an attacker discovering the plaintext, vs only having a single ciphertext. 

An example:

Take plaintext $P_1$ and encrypt it with $K_1$, and send the resulting ciphertext $C_1$ to attacker $A_1$.

In addition: take the same plaintext $P_1$ and, and encrypt it with $K_1$, giving $C_1$. Then take $P_1$ and encrypt it with $K_2$ giving $C_2$, then $K_n$ giving $C_n$ and send all $n$ ciphertexts to attacker $A_2$.

How much more likely is attacker $A_2$ to discover the value of $P_1$, than $A_1$?
",Zack Newsham,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/13023,"
  Does re-encrypting the same value with multiple keys reduce security?


The answer is ""it depends""; there are some attack models and encryption methods where the security is reduced, there are other cases where there appears to be no security reduction.

Let us go through some models where we actually see a security reduction:

Plaintext guessing attack and deterministic encryption


In this attack model, the attacker has a guess to the plaintext $P_{guess}$ and wants to confirm whether $P_1 \stackrel{?}{=} P_{guess}$.  What he can do is guess random keys $K_{guess}$ and compute $E_{K_{guess}}(P_{guess})$ and he if that appears in one of the ciphertexts he's been given.  If he happens to guess a key $K_i$, then ciphertext $C_i$ will match, and he will get confirmation that his guess is likely to be correct - that's because we assume that the encryption is deterministic and so if the keys and the plaintext match, the ciphertext will as well.  Obviously, using more keys means that there are more targets the attacker can stumble into.

Deterministic stream ciphers, and plaintext with known linear relations.


Here, we assume we don't know the plaintext, however we do know certain linear relations between the bits of the plaintext; for example, we may know that the parity of each byte is even.  We also assume that the cipher works by generating a keystream (as a function of the key), and then exclusive-or the keystream with the plaintext to form the ciphertext.

So, what the attacker can do is examine each ciphertext; by assuming that the linear relationships hold in the original plaintext, he can evaluate the corresponding linear functions on the keystream; in the example, he can compute the parity of each byte of the keystream.

Then, he can pick random keys, and generate the corresponding keystream (here, we assume that this is determanistic).  Then, he can compute the linear function of that keystream (in the example, the parity of each byte), and see if it matches one of the keystreams that correspond to the known ciphertexts.

Like the first example, having more targets makes it more likely that the attacker will guess the correct key.

(Also, if you think that the example of ""parity of each byte is even"" is contrived, a more realistic example is ""the msbit of each byte is 0"").

Deterministic RSA encryption


If the encrypt the exact same message (without padding, or using determanistic padding) to $n$ different keys, and $n \ge e$ (where $e$ is the common public exponent), then it's easy to recover the message.  This is typically used as an example why you need to add randomness to your RSA encryption, even if you don't care about plaintext guessing attacks.



The above are three examples where encrypting with multiple keys can reduce security; in other cases (such as CBC-mode encryption), there is no obvious way to use multiple ciphertexts.

Now, the obvious thing about all three examples are that they are deterministic encryption; it would appear to be wise to add randomness if you are encrypting with multiple keys.

If yes, this could greatly reduce the number of actual reverse-DNS lookups.

Example (numbers slightly obfuscated): 


Log file contains a request from an IP 128.151.162.17
Reverse DNS resolves to 11.142.152.128.in-addr.arpa 21599 IN PTR alamo.ceas.rochester.edu
(So this is a visitor from Rochester University, rochester.edu)
Now, would it be safe to assume that all at least all IPs from 128.151.162.* will also resolve to rochester.edu?
What about 128.151.*.*? Is there a way to get the exact IP range?

",Max,https://serverfault.com/users/28167,"You can generally get info about netblocks from whois (eg whois 128.151.162.17 refers to CIDR: 128.151.0.0/16), but you'll probably find that there's some variation in the format of the responses you get depending on which registry is involved, and also that whois servers are likely to cap the number of requests you can make.  Also note that netblocks are typically nested with smaller ones inside larger ones, and so you may get info about multiple netblocks for one IP.

A DNS request packet can contain multiple requests, which may speed things up if you need to resolve a lot of requests, but the main techniques you need are to paralellise requests, and to cache responses.

",emersonthis,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/11363,"In general, the best place to look is in your theme folders, specifically the main theme and in the index.php file. Then the footer and header files.

Also, check your modified dates and start with the most recently modified. Especially if there are several that were all modified around the same date/time.

I've seen, and had to fix, this problem several times on people's servers. The false data is normally loaded via a script inserted into the php files of the template.

First, you should definitely read over the Wordpress FAQ for dealing with a hacked site.

Common entry points for gaining the ""access"" required to pull the injection off are outdated themes and/or plugins. It's best to run production servers with only the one active theme on the server, as well as removing unused plugins and replacing outdated active plugins.

There are a few scripts out there that you can upload to your server to help you find infected files so you can replace, clean or delete them. (Links listed below)

Again, try looking at file modified dates and check out ones you haven't modified/installed recently yet have a recent date on the.

5780,Is there a way to limit the range of the range pattern in awk?,"I am trying to use the awk range pattern to find all SQL select statements in a group of files, inspired by this stackoverflow answer.

From the awk manual:


  The pattern1, pattern2 form of an expression is called a range pattern.  It matches all input records starting with a record that matches pattern1, and continuing until a record that matches  pattern2,  inclusive.


My initial attempt was 

awk '/select/,/from/' *


where * in this case just represents a large number of varied files.

This returned several false hits on HTML select tags, so I refined my command to

awk '/[^&lt;]select[^&gt;]/,/from/' *


which seems to have eliminated most of those hits.

However, I still get some false hits from occurrences of the word ""select"" in a comment, and those hits produce very many lines of noise each before they eventually hit a ""from"" or the end of the file.
What I would like is for the range pattern not to register a match if there are more than, say, 10 lines between the ""select"" and the ""from"".

My question is: Can I make the range pattern fail to match if the number of lines between the match of pattern1 and the match of pattern2 exceeds a given threshold, and if so, how?
",Anders Rabo Thorbeck,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/112564,"You can expand the /pattern1/,/pattern2/ condition as much as you want, by adding a {} block after to be performed when this occurs:

See for example how we print those numbers being between 50 and 70, but just the first 5 matches of each block:

$ seq 200 | awk '/50/,/70/ {if ($0~/50/) {c=0}; if (c++ &lt;= 5) print}'

51
52
53
54
55
150

In your case, you may want to say something like this, that will print the first 10 lines that were matched.

awk '/[^&lt;]select[^&gt;]/,/from/ {if (c++ &lt;= 10) print}' *


A more complex solution would consist in storing all this output and then printing it at the END block. This way, you can control the block itself instead of just a specific line. I would do this storing the data in an array, etc.

2149,How does multitasking work,"I am completely clueless about the inner workings of an operating system, but I can more or less guess the approximate behaviour of many functions. One thing that I am not able to figure out, though, is multitasking.

In theory, the operating system manages time, according the CPU for small intervals to the various programs running. But it is not clear how this really works.

Say the operating system wants to start my program. The machine code is loaded somewhere in RAM, starting at a certain address. I guess then a jump should be performed to that address, allowing my code to execute. But in this way, the OS cannot regain control until I jump back.

Basically, I can imagine just two ways of making this work, but neither seems really suitable:


The operating system could read the machine instructions I want to perform and emulate them instead of executing them directly. I am intentionally vague, since I do not know how this would work, but it seems like it would slow down the program considerably.
Alternatively, the operating system could wait until I make a system call. In that moment it regains control and can check how long I have been running and do its timesharing stuff. This may work, but it seems unreliable, as I could make a long calculation which does not involve system calls and hang everything for a while.


So, it seems neither mechanism would work very well. How is multitasking actually performed?
",Andrea,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/15072,"It varies from system to system.

In nonpreemptive multitasking systems (such as the original Oberon, or the original Apple Macintosh), the operating system periodically ""polls"" all tasks, giving them an opportunity to do work.  The tasks are expected to play nicely together.  If they just have a little bit of work to do, they do it and return to the OS.  If one task has a BIG chunk to do, it is expected to break it into little pieces, and work one little piece each time it is polled.

Hardware interrupts (disk drive DMA completions, serial port interrupts, what have you) cause interrupt routines to run.  These interrupt routines may in turn notify tasks of work to be done when the task next runs.

In nonpreemptive multitasking systems, the occurrence or non-occurrence of an interrupt does not affect which task is running after the interrupt routine finishes.

In preemptive multitasking systems, it is possible for an interrupt routine to force a scheduling change.  In a traditional round-robin preemptive multitasking system, a periodic timer interrupt does exactly that.  The timer interrupt fires, the timer interrupt routine does some black magic to cause the return-from-interrupt instruction to return to the operating system's preemptive schedule, rather than to the running task, taking the processor away from the current task, and (POSSIBLY) giving it to another task.  If no other task is ready to run at that point, the current task will get the processor again, having only lost some time.

Preemptive multitasking can cause a LOT of troubles.  All of that annoying stuff about mutexes and critical sections and deadly embraces and ... show up when the processor gets taken away from you without warning.  You have to use all those things to tell the operating system that you are in the middle of mixing nitroglycerin and taking the processor away from you right now is likely to result in a large smoking virtual hole in the middle of the server room floor.

It only lasts for a fraction of a second, doesn't continue once the engine is running, and doesn't happen if I shut the engine off and start it again a few minutes later.

Does anyone know what this could be?  Is it a big deal?  I'm obviously worried about damaging the engine.  Is this a major thing?  Or is it something I can live with, provided I don't mind the frightening noise that occurs on startup.

Amplitude and frequency remains same and also wavelength is same, so are they same?? I could not detect any difference from hearing two sounds. If different what is different and can human/computer detect it? What is basically difference between two waves?
",REALFREE ,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/33887,"Actually, one wave and its 180 flip phase image can be seen as two waves with the same phase but with opposite amplitude (when one is positive the other is negative). 

The reason you cannot hear the difference between the two is that your ear (or microphone) is not sensitive to the amplitude but rather to the intensity of the wave, i.e. the square of the absolute value of the amplitude. As you can see, the difference in amplitude sign (or the phase) does not matter and both the original and its 180 flip phase image will sound the same.

What you would like to measure to see the difference between the two is the phase of the waves but as mentioned earlier, you cannot detect the phase directly. However you can measure the interference between the waves : when waves are emitted simulatenously they sum up. Now if the two waves have the same phase, then the amplitude add up (constructive interference). If the phases are 180 degree apart, then the amplitudes will cancel out (destructive interference, mentioned above). If the phase difference is somewhere inbetween, then you will get something ... inbetween (an interference pattern).

In the present case, assuming that the external IP address is 178.162.231.61 and the desired canonical hostname is ""mismis.com"", the /etc/hosts line should look like the following.

  let $\alpha$ be a infinite cardinal , show that:
  $$\alpha=\aleph_{0}\alpha$$
  where $\aleph_{0}$ is the cardinality of the natural numbers is denoted aleph-null


this equation is from a book,and I can't prove it,and the author say this is important equation,and can't prove it.Thank you for you help
",china math,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/94077,"Recall that $\aleph_\alpha$ is the cardinality of the $\alpha$-th [infinite] initial ordinal, denoted by $\omega_\alpha$.

For this proof you will need an extra fact:


  If $\alpha$ is an uncountable ordinal then $|\alpha|=|\{\delta&lt;\alpha\mid\delta\text{ is a limit ordinal}\}|$.


If $\alpha=0$ then you can prove directly that $\aleph_0\cdot\aleph_0=\aleph_0$ by using a pairing function.

Now define an equivalence relation on the ordinals below $\omega_\alpha$, $\xi\sim\zeta$ if there are only finitely many ordinals between $\xi$ and $\zeta$. I will leave you to verify that this is an equivalence relation. $\omega_\alpha$ is well-ordered, each equivalence class has a least element, and it is a limit ordinal, or zero. Otherwise its predecessor is in the same equivalence class, which is a contradiction to the minimality. And of course, different limit ordinals cannot be in the same equivalence class, because they have infinitely many ordinals between them.

So we have $\aleph_\alpha$ equivalence classes; and $\aleph_0$ points in each of the classes. Therefore $|\omega_\delta|=\aleph_\alpha\cdot\aleph_0$. Note that the axiom of choice wasn't used here, because we have a canonical ordering of each equivalence class.

Now. How to prove the fact? Usually the proof goes through defining the above equivalence relation and using the fact that $\aleph_0\cdot\aleph_\alpha=\aleph_\alpha$. So we can't really use that here. But we can use transfinite induction. It suffices to prove this for the initial ordinals, because every limit ordinal which is not an initial ordinal is either countable, or equipotent with its initial ordinal.

Suppose that for $\alpha$ it is true that for all $\beta&lt;\alpha$, either $\beta=0$ or there are $\aleph_\beta$ limit ordinals below $\omega_\beta$. Then it holds that $\aleph_0\cdot\aleph_\beta=\aleph_\beta$ for those $\beta$'s.

By contradiction there are less than $\aleph_\alpha$ limit ordinals below $\omega_\alpha$, then there is some $\beta&lt;\alpha$ such that $|\{\delta&lt;\omega_\alpha\mid\delta\text{ is a limit ordinal}\}|=\aleph_\beta$. Consider the above equivalence relation defined on $\omega_\alpha$, then it only has $\aleph_\beta$ equivalence classes, and therefore $\aleph_\beta=\aleph_\beta\cdot\aleph_0=\aleph_\alpha$, but $\beta&lt;\alpha$ and that is impossible. $\square$

So at the end we have to resort to transfinite recursion if we want to use the structure of ordinals, but it's just a scary term, it's not that scary once you understand this extremely useful technique.



Now, using the axiom of choice if $\alpha$ is an infinite cardinal then it is an $\aleph$ number. However, some people define ""cardinal"" as an $\aleph$ number to begin with, in which case you don't use the axiom of choice.

In the general form, where cardinal need not be an $\aleph$ number, it is consistent with the failure of the axiom of choice that there are cardinals which do not satisfy this property.

From the outset, you should know that the player character is Booker DeWitt, a private detective who has been hired by a pair of rather unusual people to retrieve a rather unusual girl from a rather unusual city.  

The game is quite linear, so there's little to no chance that you'll get lost and not be able to figure out what to do next.  Just keep following along, and eventually the plot will start to come into focus.

However, the plot can be relatively difficult to understand, so I won't go so far as to say that eventually things will make sense :)

There is little to no dependency between Bioshock 1/2 and Infinite.  If you haven't played the first two, you might miss out on some understanding of a few late game moments, but it's nothing major.  I believe the ""Burial at Sea"" DLC is more tightly tied to Bioshock 1, so you might want to play that game first if you plan on playing the DLC.

256,When should a supervisor be a co-author?,"What are people's views on this?  To be specific: suppose a PhD student has produced a piece of original mathematical research. Suppose that student's supervisor suggested the problem, and gave a few helpful comments, but otherwise did not contribute to the work.  Should that supervisor still be named as a co-author, or would an acknowledgment suffice?

I am interested in two aspects of this. Firstly the moral/etiquette aspect: do you consider it bad form for a student not to name their supervisor?  Or does it depend on that supervisor's input?  And secondly, the practical, career-advancing aspect: which is better, for a student to have a well-known name on his or her paper (and hence more chance of it being noticed/published), or to have a sole-authored piece of work under their belt to hopefully increase their chances of being offered a good post-doc position?

[To clarify: original question asked by MrB ]
",MrB,https://mathoverflow.net/users/2189,"well, that depends :)

For my own students I usually do not insist on being a coauthor. However, in most cases it just happens that one works together on a project which, by accident, is the thesis of one of the persons. In my experience, I had students who worked very much on their own and then they published their stuff alone. Perfectly fair to me. On the other hand, I had students which did not just ask some questions but we really worked together as I would do it with a collegue. So in this case, there was no question that we all are on the paper, sometimes even with a third person. In these cases, the student gets already some flavour of (partially international) collaborations which I believe to be worthy.

For a diploma student (that is a sort of master thing in Germany...) I'm happy if there is a good enough outcome leading to a little paper. Usually, these students are quite happy if they don't have to do it all by themselves.

For PhD students, I have the ""rule"" that there is a big global project for the thesis which is worked on, essentially in a collaboration. But I strongly encourage the students to tell me that there is some aspect, where s/he wants to work more alone and publish also alone. In fact, for a student aiming at a very good mark in the thesis, I almost expect that s/he has a paper published alone before the thesis is finished.

So, as I said, it depends very much on the situation. I think both ways have advantages and disadvantages. Important to me is that all involved persons feel good about the policy and that things are said in the beginning. Supervising students is always a matter of trust, and this aspect is certainly one of the most delicate ones...

4849,Differences in student load at liberal arts colleges vs. research universities,"Do students at liberal arts universities have 'harder' courses than students at research universities? 

Computer Science curricula at large research universities have 5 to 6 courses per semester. The Liberal Arts model dictates roughly 4 courses per semester. If the load on the student is considered to be equivalent, there must be something special to the teaching in the Liberal Arts model.

How is it that a 4 course Liberal Arts semester is as intensive as a 6 course research university semester?

UPDATE: Many of the comments below say the course load I mention above is inaccurate. I have obtained the figures as follows.


The Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium (LACS) has released 3 LACS curricula in response to ACM/IEEE CS curriculum recommendations. The first in 1986 in response to the 1978 recommendation, next in 1996 in response to the 1991 recommendation and the most recent in 2007 in response to the 2001 recommendation. The 4 year course breakdown in all the LACS recommendations is roughly the same:

4 courses per semester
30-35% CS courses, 10% math, 5% science, and the rest, i.e. 50% or more courses on arts, humanities and social sciences.

A typical graduation requirement at a research university is at least 120 credits, which comes to 5 3-credit courses per semester. Many require more than 120 so 6 course semesters are not uncommon.

",wsaleem,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/14572,"As with other commenters, I think the premise here is flawed.

I teach at a public liberal arts college which is typical of many. (Certainly our curriculum and requirements are in line with other schools in the COPLAC Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges.)

Our students are required to complete 120 credits to graduate, which over four years averages to 15 credits a semester, or five 3-credit courses. I don't believe there is any serious difference in student course load when compared to large research universities (but maybe someone will prove me wrong).

The main distinction about teaching at a liberal arts college is that the overall curriculum is broader, and students do not focus on specialization as much as integration of diverse subject areas. Instead of taking 70 or 80 credits of (say) computer science, our students take only 40-45, with the other two-thirds of their degree consisting of courses in other areas.

I inferred from the literature to avoid color photography for 2 to 3 years, or until I have a strong feeling for composition. 

It seems reasonable that first you should know to spot your interest in subject and express it on final print, a task in which colors may confuse a beginner. Besides I'm afraid that with no skill of actual seeing and analyzing I may end up with ugly oversaturated and dull images. Is there a professional opinion on subject, or I'm just inventing limitations of my own?

Turning your question around (without actually changing it), with no skill of seeing and analyzing you may end up with ugly oversaturated and dull images.

It's probably best to accept that your first images are not going to be particularly great, no matter what. But that shouldn't discourage you! Photography is a learning process. If you're interested to learn B&amp;W, then you should do just that.

and according to Einstein relation $E=mc^2$ ,this extra energy of the hot molecule has a mass.
Does that make the hot molecule heavier?
",user44947,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/44947,"According to http://www.verticallearning.org/curriculum/science/gr7/student/unit01/page05.html , the average velocity of a water molecule at 20C is approximately 590 m/s:



If you now calculate the difference in mass between water molecules ""at rest"" and moving at 590 m/s, this ratio is given by

$$\gamma=\sqrt{\left(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)}$$

Expanding this for the case where $v&lt;&lt;c$, we get

$$\frac{\delta m}{m} = \frac12\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2 \sim 2\cdot10^{-12}$$

The difference is there; it might be measurable; but it is very, very tiny. Any condensation on your colder sample will be many times heavier than the difference in mass.

Note that the above calculation is for ""cool water"" vs ""water at absolute zero"". The difference between ""hot"" and ""cold"" water will be even smaller. Also note that to do this calculation properly, you really need to evaluate the expression for $\gamma$ at every velocity, and integrate. This doesn't change the basic answer: ""yes it changes; but it is a very very small change"".

3832,How do native speakers 'guess' the pronunciation of the letters in a word they see for the first time?,"I confess! Being a non-native speaker, I struggle a lot especially when I come across a new word. And I wonder how do native speakers pronounce perfectly even though they read the word for the very first time. There should be some rule/technique? I'm not sure.

Let's take a case. 

If I see a word having 'ch' for the very first time, how do I guess it? Remember, I don't have dictionary. Nor do I have access to this great site when I encounter that word. For example, 

Take the word 'chariot'. Being a non-native with quite limited knowledge of orthography, I know that 'ch' is pronounced as in 'Charles'

But then, imagine, I came across the word 'charade'. Undoubtedly, for me, it is 'ch (as in Charles)-re-d-s'. But then, actually, 'ch' there is 'sh' (as in Shane). 

It's not just 'ch' but it goes for 'g' as well. 'G' as in 'goat' or 'g' as in 'gymnastic'. Is there any source that teaches how to pronounce a letter if it is placed after/before certain letter? Is there any such rule? The one I remember is when a word ends with 'mb', you don't pronounce 'b'. 'Bomb', 'Comb', 'Tomb' and many other words ending with 'b'.  



There are a few more words that add another nail in the coffin of my pronunciation complexity!

b) reflect regional pronunciation, so there would be many ways to spell the same word. 

The latter was the case before English spelling was standardized. There are dozens of ways to spell the word for 'sister' in Old English, for example.

The Googles of the world would have a difficult time searching if a word might be spelled in a given text in any number of ways. All searches would have to be phonetic, and the search engine would have to understand the rules of regional pronunciation, and to the degree it did not, there would be misses and false positives galore.

It's possible to ""get close"" when guessing a pronunciation, but that's about it.
If you don't recognize the word as a loan-word from another language, say, and so may be following some special rule, you won't stand much chance of guessing right. For example: depot. But for the most part, spelling of English  words does follow some basic phonetic rules that can be learned.

7046,Mathematics of a leading signal for a sine wave,"Taken from elsewhere on the web : -

""The derivative of a sine function is

d SIN(ω*t) / dt = ω * COS(ω t)
where ω = angular frequency = 2 π *frequency

and this derivative leads the original function by 90
degrees (a quarter period) because a cosine wave leads a sine wave by
90 degrees. This derivative is also different in amplitude from
the original sine wave because the cosine wave is multiplied by the
angular frequency. If we take the simple difference of equally spaced successive points of the sine wave (i.e. 20 points in a 20 period sine wave, 21 points in a 21 period sine wave etc.) we can cause that difference to have the same amplitude as the sine wave if we “normalize” the difference. Normalization is done by multiplying the difference by (1/ω). In the case the sine wave the angular frequency is 2*Pi divided by the period of the sine wave therefore the amplitude normalization factor is

Normalizer = Period / (2*π)

Using the normalizer, this difference function of sine wave now has the same amplitude as the sine wave and leads it by 90 degrees in phase (a quarter cycle). The amount of phase lead can be reduced with a little vector arithmetic. Vector addition of the sine wave and difference function results in a vector that leads the sine wave by only 45 degrees. Since this vector forms the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle, it is also larger than the sine wave by a factor of 1.414. We simply divide the sum by 1.414 to achieve the
correct amplitude for our leading signal.

In summary, we create a leading signal by taking the
difference of equally spaced successive samples of a sine wave; multiply that difference by Period/(2*π); add that product to the sine wave; and divide the sum by 1.414.""

I would like to use this approach to create a leading signal for a sine wave which always has a set constant lead e.g. the above approach gives a 2.5 point lead for a 20 period sine wave but will give a 5 point lead for a 40 period sine wave. Since I will always know the period and the difference between successive points of the sine wave, how can I adjust the vector arithmetic so that the lead will always be a constant 2.5 points (or constant 3.5 points, whatever?) irrespective of the sine wave period?
",babelproofreader,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/6882,"As $\sin(\omega t + \phi)=\sin(\omega t) \cos(\phi)+\sin(\phi)\cos(\omega t)$.  $\phi$ is the lead angle.  As you say, $\cos(\omega t)=\frac{1}{\omega}\frac{d\sin(\omega t)}{dt}$.  So $\sin(\omega t + \phi)=\sin(\omega t) \cos(\phi)+\frac{\sin(\phi)}{\omega}\frac{d\sin(\omega t)}{dt}$.

Make a dump of MYSQL database on server.

mysqldump -u username -p -h localhost dbname &gt; domain.sql

Create a archive of your WordPress website on server.

tar -czf domain.tar.gz domain.com

Download both on local machine. And extract the archive.

tar -xzf domain.tar.gz

Import database at local machine.

mysql -u username -p -h localhost dbname &lt; domain.sql

Now change wp-config.php values for local server.
Change domain name in MySQL. You can run these mysql queries to replace it with local domain setup.

UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = replace(option_value, 'http://www.oldurl.com', 'http://www.newurl.com') WHERE option_name = 'home' OR option_name = 'siteurl';
UPDATE wp_posts SET guid = replace(guid, 'http://www.oldurl.com','http://www.newurl.com');
UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = replace(post_content, 'http://www.oldurl.com', 'http://www.newurl.com');
UPDATE wp_postmeta SET meta_value = replace(meta_value,'http://www.oldurl.com','http://www.newurl.com');



Or simply define these in wp-config.php, these will overwrite domain URLs in database. I think this will be better for local development.

define( 'WP_HOME', 'http://example.com/blog' );
define( 'WP_SITEURL', 'http://example.com/blog' );



Done.

4289,How can adversarial game mechanics be added to a game?,"Some systems have the concept of an adversarial relationship between the game master and the players. These games typically have a series of mechanics to enforce this behavior and prevent one side from becoming too powerful and running away with the game - essentially accentuating the ""game"" aspect of a RPG. What mechanics of this nature  are most likely to be easily adapted into another role-playing game?

To illustrate what I'm talking about, in D&amp;D, there are guidelines for encounter creation to create balanced encounters. How could we change this to add hard game mechanics that would enforce fairness in encounter design? As an addenda, it would also be nice to see what games these mechanics come from and how easy they are to extract from the system they were built for.
",rjstreet,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/545,"In Rune, Robin Laws' Viking RPG, the GM has to create all challenges via a very strict budgeting system as players earn Victory Points with the goal of ""winning"" the game. This allows for adversarial play within tightly defined bounds.  Unfortunately, it also means it's a colossal pain to create adventures for as a GM - I'm a big Laws fan and bought Rune sight unseen on the heels of Feng Shui but then it just sat on my shelf, as my desire to be a Norse accountant is extremely low.

This is similar to the direction D&amp;D has taken in 3e and 4e with set rules for encounter CR and now in 4e with set treasure parcels. Although in my opinion that's less fostering GM vs players as it is attempting to remove the GM or at best make them the engine under the hood.

Paranoia is a good game where the gamemaster is encouraged to ""hose"" the players.  This is mitigated by a) them having six clones, so an arbitrary death isn't the worst thing in the world and b) it being a humor game, so effectively you win by the GM stomping you out in entertaining ways. This is before everyone was obsessed with ""mechanical rewards"" for the point of the game, though, so it's not like you get extra ""points"" of some sort when it happens. But people have played it and had fun for many years.

In Mutants &amp; Masterminds they had Hero Points and when they'd spend them the villains would get Villain Points.  This went over very poorly with my group - rightly or wrongly, they felt like people besides themselves having resource driven plot immunity sucked.

8972,How to fix a Macbook Pro trackpad where the mouse pointer is randomly moving?,"The trackpad on my Macbook Pro just started acting oddly. It's randomly clicking (which might cause me to switch programs), right-clicking and even once my screen even showed the swiping animation as if I was trying to switch to a different desktop.    

Part of me fears that this is some sort of joke hacking attempt (I know of a USB device you plug into someones computer and it randomly moves their mouse and types on their keyboard), but there is nothing plugged into my machine and I just turned off the Wi-Fi and watched as this web page tried to close, the mouse right clicked twice, highlighted a word and clicked ""Paste and Match Style"" in the Chrome right-click menu.
Also as I've been typing (with my Wi-Fi turned off) the mouse has randomly been clicking inside this question and changing where I am typing.  

I just plugged in a USB mouse which seems to work fine but the trackpad is now nearly useless. I can't even move the mouse cursor more than a few centimeters with it.

Is this a common issue?
EDIT
I think it is dying actually. I can now click but not move at all with the trackpad, while a regular mouse works fine.
EDIT 2
And now it seems to be working again. I turned on the option for ""Ignore Trackpad when Mouse is plugged in"" under Universal Access. I cleaned the trackpad with rubbing alcohol, I whined and complained for a few minutes to my dog, turned off the ""Ignore Trackpad"" setting, unplugged the USB mouse, and the Trackpad appears to be working mostly normally.
If I run my finger across it at the top or bottom portion of the mouse, it works, but there is a line horizontally across it (almost exactly where a physical trackpad button would end on the old trackpads) that is ""dead"".  The mouse stops moving, or moves sluggishly when hitting that spot and that ""spot"" goes across the whole trackpad.
",James P. Wright,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/4049,"This was driving me crazy, too.

And what do you know--that fixed it. Now my trackpad is working perfectly again. Must have been something pinching or pressing against the underside of the trackpad.

I have to push the spacebar twice to get Quicklook to work properly.

4101,Exporting (bullet) collision shapes,"I'm writing a scene exporter from blender to a format to be used by a game. I need to be able to export physics information the game needs, mainly the collision shape of every object (either the one set in Blender Render or Blender Game but the latter is better).

I cannot seem to find anywhere that the collision shape is available to python. I've seen references to PhysicsConstraints.exportBulletFile() but this appears to be under the bge module, which as far as I can tell, is not accessible by exporter scripts. Is there any way to determine the details of a shape (rotation and scale, width, height, depth for box or radius and height for cylinder, vertices for convex hull, etc...)?
",luminus,https://blender.stackexchange.com/users/1789,"Finding the parameters necessary to generate such a shape should be possible with python.

From the wiki:


  The Shape setting determines the collision shape of the object. The
  following shapes are available:
  
  Primitive shapes - these are best in terms of memory/performance but don't necessarily reflect the actual shape of the object. They're
  calculated based on the object's bounding box. The center of gravity
  is always in the middle for now.
  
  
  Box: The size per axis is calculated from the bounding box
  Sphere: The radius is the largest axis of the bounding box
  Capsule: This points up the Z-Axis.
  Cylinder: This points up the Z-Axis. The height is taken from the z-axis, while the radius is the larger of the x/y-axes.
  Cone: This points up the Z-Axis. The height is taken from the z-axis, while the radius is the larger of the x/y-axes. 
  
  
  'Mesh based shapes' - these are calculated based on the geometry
  of the object so they are a better representation of the object. The
  center of gravity for these shapes is the object origin.
  
  
  Convex Hull: Convex approximation of the object, has good performance and stability.
  Mesh: Allows to simulate concave objects, but is rather slow and unstable.
  


To build these shapes using the UI:

Box:


Select the target object and press CtrlShiftAltC > Origin to goemetry, and then press F6 and select bounds center.
With the target object selected, press ShiftS> Cursor to selected to move the cursor to the objects origin.
Add a cube to be the bounding box. It will automatically be centered at the 3D cursor, which is snapped to the target object's origin point.
Copy the Dimension and Rotation values from the target object to the bounding cube. These values are located on the Properties region (N in the 3D view):



You can quickly copy and paste values by hovering over the number field and pressing CtrlC/CtrlV accordingly.

Since this process of copying and pasting the values of each channel can be a bit tedious, you can use a quick bit of python to do this for you:

import bpy

active = bpy.context.active_object
selected = bpy.context.selected_objects

for obj in selected:
    obj.dimensions = active.dimensions


This copies the dimensions from the active object to the selected objects.
Parent the bounding box to the target object so the relative location, rotation, and scale is kept the same. You can also set the bounding cube's Draw type to Wire in Properties > Object > Display > Maximum Draw Type.


Sphere


Do steps 1 to 3  from the Box instructions, adding a sphere instead of a cube. 
Copy only the largest dimension value from the target into all three dimensions of the sphere.
Do step 3 of the instructions for Box (Parent the bounding mesh and set the draw type to wire)




Cylinder


Do steps 1 to 3  from the Box instructions, adding a cylinder instead of a cube.
Copy the largest dimension value of the target excluding the Z axis, so the value of either X or Y into both the X and Y dimensions of the Cylinder.
Copy the Z dimension value of the target to the Cylinder.
Do step 3 of the instructions for Box (Parent the bounding mesh and set the draw type to wire).


Cone


Do the same as for Sphere.


Convex Hull

This is more complex. you could try to generate your own using python, or you could try one of these existing options:


The Convex Hull operator built into blender. 


Duplicate target object (ShiftD)
With the duplicate selected, enter edit mode (Tab) and select all (A)
Run the convex hull operator (Space> Search > Convex Hull)

This Convex Hull generator written in python.

4148,Invariance of dynamical system under a transformation,"I have come across an interesting property of a dynamical system, being transformed by a map, but i haven't been able to figure out why this is happening (for quite some time now actually). Any help is greatly appreciated. Here goes then:

Let M be a n-D manifold and $\dot x=F(x)u_1, F\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}, x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}, u_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be a control system evolving on M (F is the system matrix i.e. state transition function, and $u_1$ is the input of the system. For all practical purposes $u_1$ is an m-vector from an input space $\mathbb{R}^{m}$). Now let $x=\Psi (y)$ be a coordinate change on M and $u_2=M(y)u_1$ a transformation of the input $u_1$ of the first system. By applying these maps on the system, you get the new equations  $\dot y=F(y)u_2$. As you may notice, F is the same in both systems. The problem is why is this happening i.e. for what systems and transformations does this property hold?

A little more elaboration

It is useful to investigate the maps more closely. In the general case one has

$\dot x=D\Psi \dot y$
$\dot x= F(x)u_1$

thus
$\dot y=D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1$, (1)

where $D\Psi$ is the Jacobian matrix of $\Psi$. In our case it actually turns out that:  

$\dot y=F(y)M(y)u_1$. (2)

You can then consider that $u_2=M(y)u_1$ and get the final system,

$\dot y=F(y)u_2$,

that is, the same system.
 By (1),(2) you get,

$D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1=F(y)M(y)u_1 \Rightarrow (D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)-F(y)M(y))u_1=0$. 

Since this holds for every $u_1$, you have the condition,

$F(\Psi (y))=D\Psi F(y)M(y)$

So, what does this condition imply? What systems F and maps $\Psi$ hold this property (of system invariance)? I should note that F is nonlinear and a case study where this actually happens is the kinematic model of a unicycle robot i.e. this. Any ideas?
",Jorge,https://mathoverflow.net/users/19928,"Let me reply taking M to be the identity (indeed M is somewhat cosmetic to the discussion).

The identity $F\circ Ψ=DΨ\circ F$ is what one considers for example in the Grobman-Hartman theorem, passing from a dynamics to its linearization say at a fixed point. The possibilities for F are endless; $F$ would then be a topological conjugacy, perhaps locally, although maybe not very regular, more precisely at most Hölder continuous in general. Moreover, $F$ need not satisfy any invariance properties, which if I understand correctly is your main concern.

5445,Should you let users know if an email has been taken during registration validation?,"In many web applications, email is required to be a unique field, and users aren't allowed to register an account if their email already exists in the database.

When performing validation on the registration form, you would presumably check if an email has been taken, and let the user know if it has since they can either pick a different one or try to reset their password.

However, if you are providing this feedback, it seems like malicious users could test to see if users exist in the database.  Someone could plausibly test your site against leaked data from big-name hacks, and if the users are reusing their passwords across sites, then your site is potentially vulnerable.

The solution to this could be simply giving more generic feedback about what went wrong without specifically mentioning email, although that could be frustrating for the average user trying to sign up.  And if your sign up form simply requires an email and password, it is still pretty obvious that if any error is encountered it is likely that the email already exists in the database.

What is the best way from a security perspective to handle informing a user that an email has already been taken upon registration?
",IsThatQueeblo,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/68108,"An intuitive and simple solution is to make sure that an automated script (malicious script) cannot try to register with a list of e-mails in order to figure out which ones are registered. For example, use CAPTCHA challenge as part of registeration to make sure it is a human trying to register an account. In this way, even if few user e-mails are tried, a massive number cannot be checked. Note we are assuming strong CAPTCHA cannot be easily broken. 

But if it is super sensitive and you must hide who is registered at the target website even from human users, then finish the registration and do not show any error message to the user that the e-mail is already registered; and just inform the user at the end of the process that now they have to confirm the e-mail belongs to them, please go and check your e-mail; In the backend, if the e-mail is already registered, then do nothing; just send an e-mail to the owner of the e-mail and inform them: seems you tried to re-register at our service again, if you have forgotten you have an account with us, this is your username, and if you cannot remember your password, go to the password reset page. To be at the safe side, you can mention that if you did not try to register with us again, please ignore this e-mail. 

If the e-mail is not registered in the database, in the backend, create a random one-time use token in a URL and send to the new e-mail registered and ask them to confirm the new account if they meant to create a new account.

",Arun Singh,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1242844,"Browsers have built-in ""sane defaults"" for the CSS of most HTML elements - this just prevents your page looking completely unreadable if you have pure HTML without CSS, but they are of course intended to be overridden by your own CSS.

The default browser styles are typically referred to as a ""User Agent Style Sheet"" - the following site is a good reference of the various peculiar UA sheets IE has had over the years and also provides ones for other browsers at the bottom:

One method a lot of people use to ""normalise"" the defaults so you have the same starting point in all browsers is a ""CSS Reset"" - this is just a snippet of CSS that you place before your own CSS that sets all of the UA styles to the same thing. This is a well known one:

7334,Another instructor is pushing me out of the classroom right after my class ends,"I am a graduate student in math in my final year, and for several years have been teaching at my department as a lecturer. This semester, in the same lecture hall there is another lecture that starts 20 minutes after my class ends. It's taught by another instructor from my department. I usually have many students coming to office hours and there are also students asking questions immediately after lecture. Due to other activities, I cannot have office hours right after the lecture this semester and can only stay for about 15 minutes to answer questions.

Many times in the past I had a similar situation and never had any issues with it. This semester the instructor who is teaching right after often arrives 20-15 minutes before her class starts and tells me immediately that I have to go with my students somewhere else. 

I make sure to leave the blackboard clean and take all my stuff away from the instructor's desk before she arrives, but I do believe that I have a right to stay in the classroom after my lecture for at least 5-10 minutes. There is no vacant classroom around, and I don't have time to go with students to my office, which is in a different building.

Last time the instructor told me in front of my students that I don't understand ""simple things"" and that I am ""playing games"". When I was talking to one of my students, she stood very close to us and clearly demonstrated that she wanted us out. I tried to explain her that I couldn't go anywhere else due to my time constraints, but she didn't want to listen to me. I really don't understand what ""simple"" things she meant and what ""games"" I am playing. 

We leave the board clean. She doesn't need to set up a projector. She can still talk to her students before her class starts, if she wants to (even though it seems like her students don't ask her any questions before their class). So, I don't see how I cause any disruption. 

I had met this woman many times before this semester, but we never talked. I didn't see her talking to other instructors/students much, and she seems to be quite reserved and a bit neurotic. She doesn't want to have any conversation with me regarding the issue.

I felt really offended after last class when she said those things to me in front of my students. What would you do in my case? 

Added later: There are no official rules regarding classroom occupancy between classes. Instructors are supposed to use common sense and be reasonable. For me using 50% of the break time seems reasonable to answer questions after lecture seems reasonable. I agree that for some people it may not.

I don't block the entrance to the classroom. A few students from the next class who come earlier always go ahead and take their seats as soon as my students start leaving the room. I also had one of the students from the next class listening to my explanation to one of those after-class questions and asking me further questions before their class (which is the same class as I am teaching, just a different section). Maybe the instructor got jealous, I don't know.

The entrance to the classroom is from its front (not back), so I do stay in the front. But it is a big lecture hall, and there is a plenty of space in front of the room (the board itself consists of 8 huge panels).

Also, during my career as a grad.student who is also teaching for the department, I have had several observations from experienced professors who are considered to be great teachers at the department and are in charge of undergraduate teaching policy. In my evaluations the fact that there are always several students approaching me with questions after class considered as very positive, meaning that students find me approachable. 

Thank you everyone for answers. 
",Lidd88,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/31345,"If I were in your situation, I would ask the other professor for a reason and explain that I wanted to make an announcement to my students at the next lecture. If the response is ""because I want you out"" then I would politely explain that I would announce to the students that we could only remain for 10 minutes after class after which time we would all need to be out of the room. 

No need to make it confrontational.  I find that if you offer to help people solve a problem that helps reduce tension.  If this professor doesn't actually have a problem then offering to help solve a problem will be a non-confrontational way of pointing that out.  

This worked for me last semester.  We only had 15 minutes between classes and my course was taught in a computer lab. Quite often students had questions about projects they were working on and already had their code pulled up on their screen.  Unfortunately the students from the following course would be filing in and because their course required them to have access to code on a particular machine (shared drives wouldn't work) they needed particular seats which my students were still occupying. 

In my case, the professor after me simply explained why he needed the room and at the next lecture I explained to my students why they needed to exit within 5 minutes of the end of class. Everyone understood, no tension, no confrontation.

6908,"How to prevent the ""Too awesome to use"" syndrome","When you give the player a rare but powerful item which can only be used once but is never really required to proceed, most players will not use it at all, because they are waiting for the perfect moment. But even when this moment comes, they will still be reluctant to use it, because there might be an even better moment later. So they keep hoarding it for a moment which will never come. 

In the end, they will carry the item around until it is outclassed by other, more readily available resources, or even until the very end of the game. That means that such one-shot items don't provide any gameplay-value at all. They are simply too awesome to use.

What can you do to encourage the player to make use of their one-shot items and not hoard them?
",Philipp,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/21890,"A simple solution would be to make this special item available in-game for a limited time.

That way, most players used their darts and their purpose has been fulfilled.

Another example from my game experience comes from an old game called ""Star Wars Jedi Outcast Academy II"", I remember that I aquired some rare items like Seeker drone, which were supposed to help you fight your enemies. Due to their rarity I have kept them until the end of the game, hoping they can help me fight the final boss, but to my dissapointment it hasn't even left a scratch on him.

  Those of you familiar with this technique of converting time to a decimal may recall that Excel 2003 allowed you to enter a date and time like “1/1/07 11:00 AM” directly in the  axis option min/max fields and Excel would calculate the appropriate decimal representation.

Marketing is way more efficient (aka delivering better conversion rates) if the promise made in the marketing messages (usually: ""Our product is great"") is kept by the product itself. And many successful digital products distinguish themselfs by great UX.

I've seen products failing presumeably due to bad UX, even though great marketing efforts have been made. And I saw products failing that had great UX - some because of a mismatch in product-market-fit. Some failed because the world never got to know about the product, as a result of the absence of good marketing, PR etc. 

That said, I think a valuable product with a great user experience is the precondition for efficient marketing and makes the job of marketing much easier. The ROI of marketing activities for a good or great product is certainly higher than for bad products. 

Back to the Innocent example: 
Customers loved these smoothies and since they loved them so much, they would tell their friends, and they would buy them too. This is word-of-mouth marketing and the same holds true for great digital products, which we usually call ""going viral"".

My summary: 
Spend your budget on building a valuable product with great UX first and safe a part of the budget to do marketing then - as a result the ROI on the marketing budget spent will be much higher.

3286,Faceted search - Filters than can be applied to only one type of content,"I'm currently working on the global search of a site. When the user submits a search, he can see 3 types of content: company, contact and news. Filter options are available on the left side.
I have filters that can be applied to any kind of content (e.g. region) and filters that are relevant to only one kind of content (e.g. company size).

I'm wondering which approach is the best to deal with those 'conditional' filters:


Drill-down approach: when the user selects a content type, additional filters are added and they are only related to that type of content.
Example: Amazon.
All filters available at all time: if the user selects a filter that can be applied to only one type of content, the content type will be changed accordingly.
Example: LinkedIn.






Thanks for your help :)
",Leo,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/25518,"I'd go with the drilldown approach and only display filters that are applicable to the currently applied filters. 

If I understand correctly, the second approach would lead to a reset of the first option. E.g. if a user selects Contact first and then tries to apply the Company size filter would result in changing the content type to Company. This is not only confusing, it's also very frustrating for the user as they have to start all over again.

7433,Silverlight: Returning value from synchronous method using Rx,"I am writing a simple Silverlight application and WCF Service.
I want to create a synchronous method that return a value.

        string myResult = getMyBook(txtBookName.Text);
        MessageBox.Show(""Result\n"" + myResult);

    }

    // I want this method can be called anywhere, as long as the caller still in the same namespace.

            );

        svc.GetBookAsync(bookName);
        return returnValue;
    }


When I click btnCreate, myResult variable still empty. Is that something wrong with my code? Or maybe I am just don't understand with Rx concept? I am new to Rx.

My goal is : I need to get the result (myResult variable) from asynchronous method, and then used in later code.
",Trom,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1219992,"This is more suited to the async/await keywords than Rx. Rx is primarily for managing streams of data, whereas in this case all you want to do is manage an asynchronous call synchronously. You could try using Rx like so:

    svc.GetBookAsync(bookName);

    var o = Observable.FromEventPattern&lt;GetBookCompletedEventArgs&gt;(svc, ""GetBookCompleted"");

However, if GetBookAsync raises the event before you subscribe, the thread will block forever. You could mess around with .Replay() and .Connect() but you should probably just use async/await!

“the twists in the twisted pair cable are used to avoid the unwanted signals. For example one twist, one wire is closer to the noise source and the other is farther; in the next twist the reverse is true. Twisting makes its probable that both wires are equally affected by the unwanted signal. This means that the receiver which calculate the difference between the two receives no unwanted signal.”

Now ok I understood the purpose of twists but I am confused about how receiver will calculate the difference when it will receive the signal?. How unwanted signal will be eliminated ? 
Another thing that I want to make clear is ,  I am beginner please provide such an answer that can be understood.
",Zia ur Rahman,https://serverfault.com/users/44270,"A 'voltage' as such, is very difficult to measure.  In fact, it's hard to even define it.  What's always used is a 'voltage difference'.  A typical 'AA' battery uses chemical energy to keep a voltage difference of 1.5V between its contact points.  A light bulb will light up when a voltage difference forces electric charges to flow through its filament.

Think of a waterfall, the energy of the fall depends only on the difference between the altitude at the top and the bottom of the fall.  it doesn't matter if it occurs on top of a mountain or at sea level, as long as the fall itself is the same length.

in old 'single ended' signals (like rs-232, a parallel port, old IDE), bits are represented by the voltage of individual wires.... and a 'reference point' (or ground connection).  it's always a voltage difference, but the reference is constant, so it's not always mentioned.

in 'differential signals' (ethernet, 'ultra scsi', any modern serial port (USB, SATA, SAS, FireWire, even PCI-ex!)), each signal is carried by two wires, usually twisted together (or very close traces on a printed board), and the receiver doesn't use a common reference point to measure the voltage difference, it uses the difference between the two signal wires.  This way, it doesn't matter if wire A is 22v and wire B is 25V, or A is -10v and B is -7V; it only matters that B is 3V higher than A.

7831,Is there a name for the number of values a variable can take?,"For example, a bit or a boolean can be either 0 or 1 so the number 2 is associated with it. Similarly, for a byte which is 8 bits, the maximum number of different assignments would be 2^8.

Is there a name for this number?

When we pass everything through our system that has ECMAScript, Java and MySQL, then a boolean does not have only two possible assignments. For instance, a false boolean gets saved as a 0 and the boxed value could be null so a boolean suddenly can get true, false, 0, 1, null or even undefined or &lt;missing&gt;.

I think it could get problematic in tests to guarantee that the values are not inconsistent. For instance, a value boolean locked could become null and then when a script or a layout template evaluates it then it will evaluate to false somewhere if the real value was null and similar problems.

So why don't we always assert that a boolean has the same number of possible values (2 values) and similarly for other types?

There is a mathematical term named ""arity"" that is something similar but not exactly, and statistics and probability theory also has the concept of ""event space"" that would be almost exactly what I mean. For instance, the event space for a boolean would be the set {0,1} which has cardinality 2 and that cardinality doesn't get preserved throughout the system, especially when data is passed as polyglots and/or serialized (json, jsonp, xml, yaml).
",Niklas Rosencrantz,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/12893,"I would call it cardinality (and indeed I have used it in that sense). It is strictly the cardinality of the set of all values a variable can take.

Edit: for example, a 16-bit integer can take exactly 65536 values. The cardinality of the set of all values that the integer can take is 655536.

Once you start to consider variables that have a range of valid values and also a range of invalid values (like a boolean with a bitwise value of 17), then you have to extend the concept somewhat, but you can still describe those values with set notation and the concept of cardinality still applies.

Edit: Yes, this is the mathematical set, not programming Set. If you were to apply the concept to the C# type short and derive the type short?, this would not have 65537 values, represented by the union of the set of 65536 values mentioned previously and one additional value, null.

But I don't really understand this whole OSI layering. I do know that the IP is saved in the second layer, and I guess that the IP restriction will just look for this layer. 

Is it possible to read out the password from the 7th layer, even if I have an IP restriction?
",Harrys Kavan,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/16353,"The OSI layers are a model which was not meant for IP but for an older, competing protocol. IP does not fit well in that layer, especially when envisioning SSL (which must be both in layer 6 and layer 4, which is logically impossible). These layers are just confusing, so don't use them.

IP restrictions means that your server will refuse to pursue connections which are tagged with the wrong IP address. This does not protect the data against eavesdroppers.

Let me take an analogy: suppose that your connections are good old letters, with a destination address, and a sender address. The envelopes are transparent. The equivalent of IP restrictions is when the recipient refuses to even open, let alone respond to, envelopes which are not tagged with a ""known sender"" address. But nobody guarantees that the sender address written on the envelope is genuine; sending a letter with a fake sender address is easy. Of course, if I, an attacker, send a letter with your address as alleged sender, I won't see the response (unless I plunder your mailbox). But the recipient may have already have acted upon the letter contents, believing them to originate from you. Moreover, since the envelopes are transparent, every postman may read the contents of the letters.

For real protection, you need opaque letters, entrusted to armed conveyers in an armored vehicle. In the Internet world, this is called SSL (aka HTTPS in a Web context).

843,SASS Index in nested list,"I'm trying to get the index of an item in a nested SASS list — by the first property. But the only way i can get a result is to include both properties in the item. 

Is is doable with native SASS, or would it require a mixin/function? And any input to how i would do that?

$icons : (
  'arrow--down--full' '\e806', /* '' */
  'cog' '\e805', /* '' */
  'info' '\e807', /* '' */

And my lookup

//Working
index($icons, 'search' '\e804');

//Not working, but what i want to achieve
index($icons, 'search');

",Christian Werther,https://stackoverflow.com/users/786123,"It sounds like what you're talking about is a hash or lookup table, which Sass does not currently have. However, you can easily work around that in a variety of ways. Here are some examples.

You could structure your list a little differently:

$icons : (
  'arrow--down--full', '\e806', /* '' */
  'cog', '\e805', /* '' */
  'info', '\e807', /* '' */
  ...
);


I've added a comma after each item. Now to look it up you'd write a function like

@function lookup($list, $key) {
  @return nth( $list, ( ( index($list, $key) ) + 1) );
}


And call it like so

lookup($icons, 'cog'); // =&gt; '\e805'


You could push this a little further by making 2 different lists and then associating them via a similar function:

$icon-keys:    ('arrow--down--full', 'cog',    'info' ... );
$icon-values:  ('\e806',             '\e805',  '\e807' ... );


I've lined up the values with whitespace only to make them more legible to me so that they appear a bit like an actual table, but there are tons of ways of writing Sass lists, and you may prefer another. Then the function that associates them:

@function lookup($lookup-key, $all-keys, $all-values) {
  @return nth($all-values, index($all-keys, $lookup-key));
}


And using it:

lookup('cog', $icon-keys, $icon-values); // =&gt; '\e805'


For my tastes, these are both a bit clunky so I'd make a shortcut function to make it a bit more legible:

for the first variation:

@function icons($lookup-key) {
  @return lookup($icons, $lookup-key);
}


for the second:

@function icons($lookup-key, $types: $icon-keys, $values: $icon-values) {
  @return lookup($lookup-key, $types, $values);
}


so you could just in either case call

icons('cog');


You'd probably want to put a little more logic in your lookup functions to error catch, and you could also expand it to both accept and return a list rather than a single value, but this is just a basic example.

Use the CodeModuleManager methods getModuleDownloadTimestamp() or getModuleTimestamp() (not sure which one would give the proper information) to look up the ""install time"" of the module, then store it in persistence.  Then each time the app is started, read the value from the module again and compare it to the persisted value.  If the module value is newer, then the app was reinstalled.
If you store a non-native class in the Persistent Store (i.e. a subclass of Hashtable), it will be removed from the persistent store when you uninstall the app (since without the app, the class is meaningless).  So all you need to do is create a subclass of Hashtable and store that in your persistent store (with your actual data as keys), and it will be automatically removed from the store when the user uninstalls the app.

384,How does arbitary code execution work?,"I'm unable to understand how arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities are supposed to work.

Wikipedia mentions:


  Arbitrary code execution is commonly achieved through control over the instruction pointer of a running process.


Say, the vulnerability is being triggered by some maliciously crafted file that said process is reading. How could it modify the instruction pointer, or, otherwise, corrupt the internal state of the application so as to cause it to execute the attacker's code?

Also, given that modern OSes implement DEP and ASLR, how is this even feasible? The data loaded from the application would not even be executable, and additionally, it's also difficult to determine the offset of the shellcode/payload.

Brownie points for showing a small snippet of code that would be vulnerable to such an exploit.
",user2064000,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/22260,"Code injection / Code execution is any attack that involves tricking a node in a distributed system into running code specified in a network message that was supposed to be treated as plain text/bytes.

The arbitrary part means that the vulnerability allows the attacker to make use of the full authority of the running process or of some privileged principle like root.




  given that modern OSes implement DEP and ASLR, how is this even feasible


Code injection relies on some other kind of vulnerability to inject the payload.  You're probably thinking of injection via buffer overflow but there are other ways to inject code that memory address space tricks don't help against.

Code injection doesn't necessarily mean injecting instructions in the processor's instruction set into a code/data segment.  It can mean injecting source code in a scripting language which the program foolishly interprets.  For example, shell injection involves injecting bytes that are passed to a shell.


  Shell injection (or Command Injection[10])is named after Unix shells, but applies to most systems which allow software to programmatically execute a command line. Typical shell injection-related functions include system(), StartProcess(), and System.Diagnostics.Process.Start().




Some systems have used string tainting * to try to mitigate code injections that aren't covered by DEP/ASLR and it does help but isn't foolproof:  taint bits aren't serialized when strings are serialized to files/DBs and, under maintenance, more untaint instructions are added to a program to fix high visibility non-security bugs than are removed to fix low-visibility security vulnerabilities.


  The concept behind taint checking is that any variable that can be modified by an outside user (for example a variable set by a field in a web form) poses a potential security risk. If that variable is used in an expression that sets a second variable, that second variable is now also suspicious. The taint checking tool proceeds variable by variable until it has a complete list of all variables which are potentially influenced by outside input.




Systems that label strings based on information flow have also been used to secure distributed systems that have to mix strings of different provenance, but information-flow is more of an all-or-nothing approach: harder to retrofit onto systems that were not designed around it.


  Information ﬂow control protects information security
  by constraining how information is transmitted among
  objects and users of various security classes. These security classes are expressed as labels associated with the information or its containers.


Taint-checking, above, is a very simple kind of information flow analysis in which the labels are restricted to (tainted, untainted).

One thing I've noticed when running code through JSLint is its insistence that the ++ increment operator is somehow evil. I know I can turn certain rules off, but that's cheating ;). Crockford mentions his dislike on page 112 of JS: TGP...


  In my own practice, I observed that when I used ++ and --, my code tended to be too tight, too tricky, too cryptic. So, as a matter of discipline, I don't use them any more. I think that as a result, my coding style has become cleaner.


That's all very lovely, but he doesn't give any examples of the way he codes them now. I assume he's doing something like...

var i;
i = 0;
i = i + 1;


Again, great, but I've got a few basic 'for loops' in my JS code, as I imagine many people have, and I've always used the standard syntax...

for (i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) { 
    // Loop Stuff 
}


Am I missing something? What's the cleanest and/or best way to increment/decrement?
",Daniel Attfield,https://stackoverflow.com/users/545030,"The only tricky thing I see in autoincrement/decrement operators (and I'm quite surprised that no one here pointed that out) is the difference between prefix (++i) and postfix (i++) versions. I also believe that autoincrement/decrement operators are slightly more efficient, in general. Besides this, I think the choice is based mainly on aesthetics, especially in javascript.

3677,How do you decide when a paladin has fallen from grace in DnD 5e?,"There does not seem to be a clear-cut way to determine when a paladin's actions have become egregious enough to justify them breaking their oath. Do a lot of minor slights eventually add up and cause an oath to be broken? Do they get some sort of warning like losing their laying on of hands ability? 
",adclark09,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/22899,"You're right.  There is no clear cut way.  That's by design.  How this works varies a lot by playstyle:

Some groups have a solid understanding of ethics and jurisprudence and use some limited form of said understanding adjudicate alignment in D&amp;D.  Others use their full understanding of ethics, which cumulates for them into a D&amp;D compatible system, to perform that adjudication.  These groups are very similar except that the first group tends to have less issues adjudicating alignment in difficult situations where the latter group discovers holes in their beliefs about morality.  In both of these cases alignment is adjudicated according to the chosen moral/ethical system, and what constitutes oath-breaking will be adjudicated similarly according to the related principles of jurisprudence. As moral relativism becomes, unfortunately, increasingly popular, objective alignment becomes less and less so, especially amongst simulationist groups, and so these two methods of alignment adjudication are unlikely.

Some groups think alignment is stupid, meaningless, and entirely subjective.  These people are very vocal.  They likely also think that oathbreaking is similarly problematic.  Like alignment-based powers in previous editions, in these groups if you're going to use anything that's based off alignment or alignment-like systems (like the paladin class) you should first check with your DM to find out 1) if it's allowed and 2) what it means in the context of the campaign.  One common solution in the past in these kinds of groups has been just to waive the alignment restriction entirely, for the Paladin class.

Some groups think that obviously alignment is objective, because it's in the rules, but they just don't understand it yet.  These groups will post difficult alignment questions as they come up on online fora.  The outcome of alignment based actions in such groups will be fickle and likely a point of tension.

Some groups try and adjudicate this according to the original inspiration for the alignment system, which is a set of novels written by Michael Moorcock.  This is hard because the novels are novel-y and don't explain exactly what Law and Chaos are in cut and dry terms.  Such groups would probably not adjudicate the oath the same way they do alignment, because Jurisprudence is fundamentally a principle of Balance, not Law, in that system, and there's almost nothing to go on for how something like the 5e paladin oath should be dealt with.

In any case, if you are not the DM, ask your DM how the metaphysics of ethics and jurisprudence are related in their game.  If they are related, seek to focus more on the adjudication of ethics than jurisprudence as the ethical component is probably dominant in most GM adjudications.  If they are not related, ask about Jurisprudence in general, and the adjudication of your class abilities in particular, if necessary, focusing on what an Oath means, what it means to break it, and how reparations might be made if the oath is indeed broken.

If you are the DM, I strongly recommend you consciously decide what philosophical system of justice you will use in your campaign, as all of the other options amount to unconsciously using some system and putting some introspective thought into this choice before you start running the game is likely to make these kinds of decisions much easier and much faster during the game sessions, since you will spend much less time figuring out how to approach each specific case.

If you want a place to start looking at different approaches to the philosophy of oaths, I recommend this paper.

4277,Measuring Resistance of a Wire With an ADC,"I'm trying to design a circuit which can measure small resistances down to 0.1 Ohm and a max. of 10 Ohms. I won't be measuring actual resistors but rather large coil of wires, upto 500 m (as you can imagine, these wires are quite thick).

Here's the circuit I came up with:


The circuit works by maintaining a constant current through the device under test, R2. With a current of 100 mA, R2 would develop a voltage between 10 mV to 50 mV.

I think in an ideal world this would work but in practice I may have a hard time measuring 0.1 Ohms with this - mainly due to the ADC. Let's assume the ADC is 10-bit with VREF of 5V. This translates to 5mV per step. If R2 = 0.1 and Iout = 100 mA, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 50 mV - but I'm not sure how buried under noise this would be.

My question is, should I increase the gain to, say, 50. If the gain is 50, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 500 mV - but the max. measurable resistance would be 1 Ohms. To measure 10 Ohms, I would need to lower the current to 10 mA instead of 100 mA. A way to do that would be use an FET to switch out R1 and connect a 20 Ohm resistor at Iout.

I don't need the circuit to measure the resistance precisely - a tolerance of +/- 10% is fine.
",Saad,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/3966,"First of all, this setup will not allow you to get a range of 0÷5V at the ADC input. Simply because the LM324 cannot swing up to its positive rail. It will also introduce potential offset voltages that will most certainly be able to ruin a 10 to 50mV measurement. 

I suggest getting an instrumentation amplifier or a selectable gain amplifier such as the MCP6G01. With a selectable gain from 1 to 100 you'll be able to maintain some accuracy within 2 orders of magnitude (e.g. from 0.1 to 10 Ohms).

Note: According to the docs, layersAdded is ""[...] emitted for layers added to the registry, but not to the legend and canvas.""

",atheistlearner,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/66433,"Think of this in terms of a sliding scale, from LOW-level languages all the way through to HIGH-level languages. As a language moves up the scale, from LOW to HIGH, the language provides more and more abstraction from the specific interface with the computer.

LOW-level languages are written to explicitly direct the computer - think machine code and assembly code.

HIGH-level languages attempt to abstract away the nitty-gritty details (particularly memory allocation and release of memory). The idea is to provide a more ""natural"" interface to programming and hopefully allow the programmer to focus on design and production.

These days, C is regarded as a LOW-level language. It still has some significant abstractions from machine code and assembly code, so is technically 'higher' than these. However, it does still provide direct memory addressing and not provide garbage collection. So these are details a programmer must design for.

Compare this to other languages such as Python, Ruby or Haskell and you have a much more obscure interface. These languages have large libraries of code that abstract away most of the computer command. Ever wondered what happens to a variable in Python when you leave the local scope of a function, or delete it? Probably haven't right? And that is because in a HIGH-level language you don't have to! They look after the memory allocation / release for you.

HIGH-level languages have the advantage of function. They allow us to design and develop freely (and safely!).

LOW-level languages have the advantage of speed in most cases. There is a cost to interpreting HIGH-level code. Plus, it is kinda cool to write something in 'computer speek'.

1965,SQL Server: update table from xml string,"this is the first time I am working with an XML input in SQL. 

I created the following procedure to insert all records from my XML string into my table which works well so far. 

Can someone tell me how I have to change this so that it only inserts a record as new if the itemID (every record in my XML has this as well) does not yet exist in my table, column itemID - otherwise it should update the existing record with the new data from the XML. 

I know how to use IF NOT EXISTS and UPDATE in general but am not sure how to realise this with an XML string as the input. 

My procedure (so far): 

ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[editor_UpdateQuestions]
    @xml xml

BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;

    INSERT INTO editor_Questions
        (
            categoryID,

            sortID,

            ParamValues.x1.value('modBy[1]', 'varchar(50)')

I know this answer is not what you are expecting - but try it.

The first problem is that $(3r^4)^3=3^3r^{12}=27r^{12}$, not $9r^{12}$. I’m not sure how you got $311$: $2^5\cdot9=32\cdot9=288$, and the correct $2^5\cdot27=864$. In the denominator you have two errors that cancelled each other out: the original $(6r^3)^2$ is $6^2r^6$, not $6r^6$, but that means that $36r^6$ is correct.

Upon logging in, I noticed I have a pretty low score (not that surprising since I just opened my first credit card recently), but I had a look around anyway just out of curiosity.

What I found out was that I have three medical bills in collections from my local clinic that total around $250!

What's odd is that I have insurance that should have paid those costs, and I've never received bills from them before for that reason.

What can be done to get this removed from my credit report without paying it, since I wasn't supposed to pay it in the first place.  Likely this started out as just an insurance mistake between the clinic and my insurance.
",Soviero,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/15097,"This happened to me when I went to buy my house. I had an ""outstanding"" $48 and $150 in medical bills due. When I paid them, I got checks 8 weeks later for the exact amounts I'd written, stating that it was over-payment. When I called the hospital, they said that collections didn't have updated billing records.

1) Contact the clinic

Ask if you actually owe anything. They'll be able to pull all of the billing records for your account. If you do owe something, let them know that your insurance was supposed to cover that. If they insist that insurance doesn't / didn't, then you're liable for whatever is left. If it has gone to collections, you'll have to pay through the collections company, not directly to the clinic.

2) Contact the collections company

They are notoriously bad at keeping their records up-to-date, and will continue to report ""unpaid medical"" until you pay it or they clear it. If the clinic says you're paid up, let them know that. They will contact the clinic to get the billing records. Once that's cleared up, move on to...

3) Contact the credit bureaus where this is affecting your history

You can dispute an item to have it removed. They will contact the collections company and raise the dispute. If you've contacted collections, and they know you don't owe anything, they'll clear it when the dispute reaches them. 

This process can take a few months to complete (and for the bad mark to be removed from your report). In general, a single $250 medical bill past due doesn't have a huge effect on your credit score, but it's always good to get it cleared up.

One possible way is to show that we cannot create the function $\lnot$. I tried to prove it by using induction on the structure of $A$. If $A$ is a formula and $V$ is a model that gives $f$ to all atomic formulas then $V(A) = f$. The base case is $A = p$ and so $V(A) = f$. We assume that it holds for the formulas $B$ and $C$. We have $A = xor(B,C)$ and by using the induction hypothesis and the definition of $xor$ we get $V(A) = f$.

If we consider now $F_{n+1}^{\land}(p,q)$ (i.e $F_n^{\land}(p,q) \land p$ or $F_n^{\land}(p,q) \land q$), again it is identically false.

The point of this script is to show last added 12 photos (thumbs of it). And this works perfect. But I want to add second funcionality - link to the page where it comes from (usually native gallery embed into post/page)

The problem is that in this case the link is corrupted. It always links to the very first post. What I am doing wrong?

8884,A helical cycloid?,"While combing around my notes looking for other possible examples for this question, I chanced upon another one of my unsolved problems:

Cycloidal curves are curves generated by a circle rolling upon a plane or space curve. It's not too hard to derive the required parametric equations if the fixed curve is a plane curve, but I've had some trouble deriving the corresponding expression for space curves.

More specifically, here is the particular problem I was concerned with: consider a (cylindrical) helix:

$$\begin{align*}x&amp;=a\cos\;t\\y&amp;=a\sin\;t\\z&amp;=ct\end{align*}$$

and imagine a circle of radius $r$ whose plane is always perpendicular to the x-y plane rolling on the helix, starting at the point $(a,0,0)$ ($t=0$). Imagine a point in the plane of the circle at a distance $hr$ from the center. What are the parametric equations for the locus of the point?

The two obvious pieces of information I have are that the center of the circle also traces a helix, whose parametric equation differs from the original by a vertical shift of $r$ (per Tony, that was an erroneous assumption), and that the expression for the arclength of the helix, $s=\sqrt{a^2+c^2}t$, should figure into the final parametric equations. Otherwise, I'm not sure how to start.

How does one derive parametric equations for the ""helical cycloid""?



The physical model I had in mind was a screw ramp winding around a cylinder. Supposing that there was a car that needed to go to the top of the cylinder by driving on the ramp, and supposing that a spot is placed on one of the car's wheels, what are the equations for the locus of the spot?
",J. M. is not a mathematician,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/498,"I like to think of helices on cylinders as images of lines under planar curling, so here's an approach incorporating that idea.

Imagine the circle rolling up a line drawn in the plane, with $P$ the point of tangency along the line and $Q$ a distinguished point on the circumference of the circle. (So, $Q$ traces out a cycloid in the plane.) Now, imagine the plane is made of thin paper, but the circle is made of stiff cardboard. If we curl the plane into a cylinder but the circle remains flat, the plane of the circle will be tangent to the cylinder along the (vertical) line passing through the point $P$. The point $P$ will follow a helix, and the point $Q$ --which lies in the plane of the circle-- traces out the helical cycloid in space. While the path that $P$ (and $Q$) takes is decidedly different after curling than before, the displacement vector between $P$ and $Q$ in the plane of the circle is the same throughout. 

Before curling, if the circle of radius $r$ rolls along a horizontal track in the $uv$-plane, then we have $P=(r t, 0)$, and the point $Q$ traces out the standard cycloid:

$$\begin{align}
u &amp;= r ( t - \sin t ) \\
v &amp;= r ( 1 - \cos t )
\end{align}$$

The displacement vector from $P$ to $Q$ at time $t$ is given by

$$d := PQ = [m, n] = r[-\sin t, 1 - \cos t ] = - 2 r \sin\frac{t}{2} \; [\cos\frac{t}{2},-\sin\frac{t}{2}]$$

Rotating the plane through an angle, say, $\theta := \rm{atan\frac{c}{a}}$, and writing $b$ for $\sqrt{a^2+c^2}$, the circle's point of tangency along the tilted track is given by ...

$$P_2 = (r t \cos\theta,r t \sin\theta) = \left( \frac{r t a}{b}, \frac{r t c}{b}\right)$$

... and the displacement vector, $d_2$, to the point $Q_2$ tracing out the tilted cycloid is given by ...

$$\begin{align}
d_2 :&amp;= [m \cos\theta - n \sin \theta, m \sin\theta + n \cos \theta ] \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{b} [a m - c n, c m + a n] \\
&amp;= -\frac{2r}{b}\sin\frac{t}{2}\left[\cos\left(\theta-\frac{t}{2}\right), \sin\left(\theta - \frac{t}{2} \right) \right] \\
\end{align}$$ 

Now the fun part: Curl the $(u,v)$-plane around a cylinder of radius $a$, such that the $uv$-origin aligns with the $xyz$-point $(a,0,0)$ and the $v$-axis runs parallel to the $z$ axis. The curled, tilted track will coincide with a helix. The horizontal distance travelled by $P_2$ in the plane becomes the length of horizontal circular arc travelled by $P_3$ around the cylinder; upon dividing by the radius, $a$, of the cylinder, this length becomes the angular ""distance"" --$s := \frac{rt}{b}$-- travelled by $P_3$; the vertical distances match. Therefore: 

$$P_3 = \left(a\cos s, a\sin s, \frac{rtc}{b} \right)=(a\cos s,a\sin s,c s)$$

As for the displacement vector: The $u$ direction of the tangent plane coincides with the horizontal vector tangent to the cylinder at $P_3$; the $v$ direction coincides with the $z$ direction. Thus, the transformation from $uv$-coordinates to $xyz$-coordinates is given by 

$$[1,0]\to[-\sin s, \cos s, 0]\hspace{0.5in}[0,1]\to[0,0,1]$$

The image, $d_3$, of the displacement vector $d_2$, then, is 

$$d_3 = -\frac{2r}{b}\sin\frac{t}{2}\left[-\sin s \cos\left(\theta-\frac{t}{2}\right), \cos s \cos\left(\theta-\frac{t}{2}\right), \sin\left(\theta - \frac{t}{2} \right) \right] $$

and the path of $Q_3$, which traces the helical cycloid, is given by

$$
Q_3 = P_3 + d_3 = \left\{
\begin{align}
x &amp;= a \cos s &amp;+ \frac{2 r}{b} \sin s \sin\frac{bs}{2r} \cos\left(\theta-\frac{bs}{2r}\right)\\
y &amp;= a \sin s &amp;- \frac{2 r}{b} \cos s \sin\frac{bs}{2r} \cos\left(\theta-\frac{bs}{2r}\right)\\
z &amp;= c s &amp;- \frac{2 r}{b} \sin\frac{b s}{2r}\sin\left(\theta-\frac{bs}{2r}\right)
\end{align}
\right.
$$

Here's a picture with $a=c=1$ and $r=1/2$:



Note: The above does not simply curl the planar cycloid around the cylinder. Since

$$x^2 + y^2 = a^2 + \frac{4r^2}{b^2} \sin^2\frac{bs}{2r} \cos^2\left(\theta-\frac{bs}{2r}\right) \ge a^2$$

we see that most of the helical cycloid lies outside the surface of the cylinder.

6052,Is it usual for finished PhD students to send out physical copies of their thesis to unknown persons?,"Some time ago, a recently-graduated PhD has sent me a physical (book) copy of his dissertation. The graduate works in a somewhat-related field, but is personally entirely unknown to me (I have some loose connections to the advisor, though). I was reasonably confused by this - I personally have never heard of a custom of sending physical theses to anybody besides maybe parents. I was 100% convinced that I received the dissertation in error (also because the mailing was addressed to my name, but using a wrong department name).

Last week I by chance got hold of the graduate and told him that he sent me his thesis by accident, and asked whether he wants to have it back. He seemed confused and a little bit annoyed that I wanted to give his thesis back - it turns out he actually sent me the book on purpose, assuming that I would be interested in his work. He told me that he thought it is customary to send a finished PhD thesis to people that he thought might profit from its results.

So, is this a thing, at least in some fields? If so, why not just send the core papers or a link to a digital version of the thesis? Mailing out printed copies seems extremely expensive, and also (at least for me) very unlikely to result in anything else than me having another book gathering dust in my office shelf. I am honestly very unlikely to read an entire thesis, especially if I only have it in a dead-tree book version.
",xLeitix,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/10094,"In some countries you print a large number of copies (as stated by Pieter Naaijkens), in some only a single digit number which should then be distributed to a specific set of recipients. Regardless it is not unusual that a person might distribute copies to people that might have some interest in it. It is, however, not a must and the recipients is up to the author. When you send a thesis I think it is wise to write an accompanying letter explaining why the thesis is sent to the specific person. To send them without such a personal note may come across as a little odd and can of course be misunderstood. 

I did my PhD in the US and made a larger number of cheap copies (do not remember how many) to distribute among friends. I sent a few to others whose research I had built on. This was outside of the, at least then, mandatory five bound copies. In Sweden, where I now reside, printing of about 250 is mandatory and the student can print additional copies at their own cost. We recommend students to think about sending their thesis to people they can imagine would be interested in it. Since the life time of a thesis is usually quite short, most will soon be properly published, it is a good way to advertise your PhD and your work right after you have completed the work.

6628,Replace multiline string in files,"I have a number of files I want to update by replacing one multi-line string with another multi-line string. Something along the lines of:

* Some text, 
* something else
* another thing


And I want to replace it with:

* different text


The result would be that after the replacement the file containing the first block of text, will now contain the second string (the rest of the file is unchanged).

Part of the problem is that I have to find the list of files to be updated in the file system, I guess I can use grep for that (though again that's not as easy to do with multiline strings) then pipe it in sed maybe?

Is there an easy way to do this? Sed is an option but it's awkward because I have to add \n etc. Is there a way to say ""take the input from this file, match it in those files, then replace it with teh content of this other file"" ?
I can use python if need be, but I want something quick and simple, so if there is an utility available, I rather use that than write my own script (which I know how to do).

8946,More dissonant chords/intervals in the bass clef when frequency proprtions are the same?,"Take for example C augmented. It sounds more consonant in the treble clef above middle C and more dissonant in the bass clef. However the proportions of the frequencies are exactly the same. This doesn't make any sense that it is more dissonant in the bass while the proportions are the same. Frequency proportions being the same should suggest the same amount of dissonance in every octave.

So why are dissonant intervals and chords more dissonant in the bass clef and more consonant in the treble clef? 
",Caters,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/9749,"Are you talking about the piano here?  Because on the piano, even single notes are more dissonant in the bass clef than in the treble clef (look up ""disharmonicity"") because of the thickness of strings.

Also for low frequency you can hear more overtones, and consequently their possible clashes.  And also for lower frequencies more beatings are in the noticeable range for the same relative discrepancies.

I know that I get a large bad wobble when playing D1 together with D#1 on my accordion.  But if I pull in the octave D2+D#2 additionally (which basically is just overtones to the bass tones), the result becomes much more unpleasant.

A mechanic told me it could be the ""body modulator"". I've never heard of this before. Could this be the problem? If so, how hard is it to change out for a shade tree mechanic?

If not, what else could this be? 
",surfer,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/979,"There is a relay in the fuse box under the hood on the driver's side.  On a 2004, it's #46 and labeled 'HDM Relay'.  YMMV.  You can swap it with a known good relay (same type from the box for something you know is working).  #45 should be the same (on a 2004 at least) and should be the engine fan clutch.  If the headlights work after the swap, swap them back and get a new relay (you don't want to have a non-operational fan).  This is from a writeup at Sparky's Answers.

Generally, start with the bulbs.  Check the connectors with a multimeter and work your way back from there.  You really need a wiring diagram.  Based on some Youtube videos, it looks like there should be a 4 pin connector on the headlight module with 4 wires, Tan, Green, Black and Black.  The blacks should be the grounds, tan should be low beam, green should be high beam.  Each bulb also has a 2-wire connector you'll also need to check if the 4-wire connector checks out. 

I suspect there is a dimmer switch somewhere, probably on the steering column. Hopefully you can get at the connector to check it without removing the lower dash or dropping the steering column.  If you know what wires go where, you can jumper the appropriate connectors to simulate a working switch set to low beam.

b. Plot the graph of the total area contained in the two fields as a function of $x$.

c. greatest area $= 17522.2222$

I keep getting the wrong answer for the greatest area.
Please provide me with explanations to each 
",user37600,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/37600,"Since $x$ is the length (in feet) of the short side of the rectangular field, then the area of the rectangular field is $2x^2$, and its perimeter is $6x$. Thus, the side length of the square field is $(600-6x)/4=150-\frac32x$, so its area is $22500-450x+\frac94x^2$, and the total area is $$A(x)=22500-450x+\frac{17}4x^2,$$ as desired.

We know in particular that we need $2x^2\geq 800$, from which $x\geq 20$ (since $x$ is positive). Also, since the square field needs area at least $100$ square feet, then its side length is at least $10$ feet, meaning $150-\frac32x\geq 10,$ from which $x\leq\frac{280}3$, as desired.

As for the last part, observe that the graph of $A(x)$ is a portion of a parabola that opens up.

1869,"Diff between backups: see permissions, group and owner and sym link differences","Question

Using only the command line, is it possible to tell if a rsync backup (on a NAS) and the original folder tree (on a web server) are exactly the same? I mean in terms of file sizes, attributes, and symbolic links?

I feat the most for symbolic links. In case of a hard-drive failure – let's say I can solve all the booting issues – will I be able to put back all the files with all the symbolic links done right and their permissions / attributes?

Context
I am setting up an rsync backup system in which my NAS (arm processor) connects to my dedicated webserver hosted far far away and does a backup of the / partition. 

In case of a disk crash, I plan on making the exact same partition setup on the new disk, on installing the same operating system (14.04) so I get the MBR / boot loader in place. 

Then I will rsync back the backup from the NAS to the server, reboot and cross my fingers.

The issue is that I will only know if everything works the day I need the backup…. But I can take measures to know if it will work before. One of them is checking that every single file, folder, sym link… in the backup has the same permissions, attributes, whatever than the original. I also need to check that the sym links and similar are correctly done.

The options I use with rsync are :

rsync -rlptgoDXvxzH --numeric-ids --exclude={""/dev/*"",""/proc/*"",""/sys/*"",""/tmp/*"",""/run/*"",""/mnt/*"",""/media/*"",""/lost+found""}


The option A is causing issues.

EDIT: ADDITIONAL INFO

What I am looking for is a working backup strategy that will allow me:

– to perform blazing fast backups.
Because I do backup the / system partition, I take most services down on the server (apache, postfix, dovecot, mysql, etc.) so I can have a safe backup. Any solution such as rsync is good, because I can update a mirror directory on the NAS. Then, offline, I can take care of the backup strategy (incremental, etc…) from the updated mirror.

– to have fast restore (I don't want to transfer a 100 GB disk image).
I have a really really fast connection between the NAS and the server. I mean really fast. Transferring a 10 GB disk image is a matter of minutes.

What I can't do: change the physical setup of the hosted server. I have one 500 GB disk. That's all.

What I can do: boot the server in a rescue mode in which the disk isn't mounted at all. Rescue mode even works with a dead disk. I use this mode to perform binary images of partitions.

Current setup: 
/     10 GB, 17 % full
SWAP 512 Mo
/var  80 GB
/bkup the rest… to 500 GB.
",Adeline,https://askubuntu.com/users/271981,"What you're really asking is: What is a good Backup Strategy for my server and that depends what you want to do when the lightning hits your server...

For me, speedy restore is what I want, so what I do is:

I have one additional small, old, cheap disk containing 2 additional partitions on the server: a 500GB ext4 partition containing the system back-ups and a  500MB FAT32 boot, diag partition (yep, MegaByte, and it's a bit too big!) containing CloneZilla.

Whenever I'm going to do some drastic changes to the server or whenever I feel I can afford a 5 minute down-time, I boot the server into the FAT32 CloneZilla partition, which then backs up my root partition excluding ""/home"" in 5 minutes! (using disk-to-image)

I've had to restore the image only once and it works like a charm: server was set back 1 month (as I wasn't sure when I introduced the problem), installed all its updates and then I had to redo my work from the last month which was basically installing a few utilities.

In addition to that, I rsync my /home and the system image backup partition weekly at Monday 03:00 am (which is when the server has its lowest usage).

If that's good enough for you, use the same strategy.

",Sathya,https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/244,"Possibility#1

If a trigger is not firing, then the insert/update/delete of the SObject is failing before the trigger is being invoked. For example, an after insert/update trigger will not fire if there are validation rule errors during the insert/update.  Or, if the before insert/update triggers execute an add.error to prevent the DML from committing.

Given that it works in stage but not PROD, you need to verify that Stage mirrors PROD in terms of validation rules and workflow field updates.

Possibility#2

Another thing to check is that if the stage testmethod uses @isTest(SeeAllData=true) it is highly likely to have different behavior in PROD than in Stage where the dataset size will be different.

Debug logs

As for debug log levels, start off by just running with Validation and Database logging and turn off Apex code and System logging to see why Possibility #1 (the DML operation is not committing) thus preventing the trigger from executing.

The way we reconcile this is two people have 10 cards which gives them a significant advantage, e.g. they can simply hold a single card of a commodity to effectively eliminate whoever ends up going for that commodity.

Are there better solutions to this? 
",John Robertson,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/800,"In the group where I've often played Pit, we discarded the Bull and Bear cards before shuffling. It makes the game simpler and better, in my humble opinion.

That being said, we can still debate which is the best solution if you do want to keep those cards. MrHen's solution may well win that honour. A different option would be to discard two cards at random every time you deal. The advantage is that the playing field is level; however, there are up to two commodities that cannot be completed. But in this version, all players are equally likely to be affected.

I could see a few variants of this variant:


Make the discarded cards secret. At the end of every round people are going to be frustrated that their chosen commodity was unwinnable.
Make the discarded cards public. Now all commodities of the discarded type are effectively Bear cards.
Start a timer for (say) 30 seconds when the round starts. At the end, if no one has won yet, play is interrupted and one of the discarded cards is made public. Players try not to give away that they were close to finalizing a ""doomed"" commodity. Play continues for another 30 seconds and is interrupted again to make the last card public. Chaos ensues.

3733,Looking up for an item in a list and different table styles in iOS,"I have a settings view with a grouped table. One of the cells of such table is intended to show a very long list of items from where I want the user to select one. Due to the length of the list, I need to provide a way to make easier to find a certain item.

One of the options I think there are, is to show letters of alphabet as indexes at the right side of a plain table. Since my first table is a grouped one, my navigation hierarchy would be then like this:

  

Would it be inconsistent to navigate from a grouped table to a plain table? If so, could somebody give an existing example? I didn't find anything related to this in iOS Human Interface Guidelines, maybe it is described somewhere else and this navigation pattern breaks the guidelines.

Another option could be having a search bar. Can a search bar be used in both a plain table and a grouped table? The existing example of such bar I found is in Contacts app and it is a plain table. In a plain table, could both an alphabet index and a search bar be shown?

4393,How does weight affect the game?,"I'm seeing weight of guns, armor, and even coins listed, but no rules seem to really make weight have any effect - other than on someone's speed.

For example: When you are drowning. I can tell you that swimming is pretty much easier when you are naked than when you are wearing heavy armor. However, the rules don't seem to care what armor do you use. Just simple DC 10/15/20 check.

So, in what situations does weight really matter? Or is it just fancy gimmicks?
",Realdeo,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/12117,"Basically, weight is used to calculate one thing. Whether or not your adventurer is overburdened with all the stuff he is carrying. 

How much you can carry is determined by the following formulas: 


  Normal Load: Multiply the creature’s Strength score by 10. The result is the weight, in pounds, that the creature can carry around without penalty.
  
  Heavy Load: Double the normal load number (that is, Strength × 20) to find a creature’s heavy load, the maximum weight it can lift off the ground. While a creature is carrying more than its normal load, it is slowed. Carrying such a load requires both hands.
  
  Maximum Drag Load: Five times a creature’s normal load (that is, Strength × 50) is the most weight it can push or drag along the ground. The creature is slowed if it pushes or drags more weight than its normal load, and it can’t push or drag more than its heavy load over difficult terrain.


So basically, if you have too much stuff (but not more than your heavy load), your adventurer is slowed. This is a big problem. For most adventurers this isn't much of an issue, fairly early on in your career you should be able to pick up a Bag of Holding, and not have to worry about load except for the gear your wearing or actively using. 

It's been pointed out in the comments that there are a couple of game mechanics that do use the weight of an item. Prestidigitation can lift up to a pound, Mage Hand can lift up to 20 (Psions and Wild Talent Masters have similar powers). So it comes into play occasionally on this stuff as well.

This is painfully slow:

SELECT * FROM Families

Example 2

This is faster:

SELECT * FROM Families

2. Commentary

As far as I can see, there are really only two things that you are trying to achieve:


To create the mixed fraction a b/c from the string ""a b/c"". But instead of implementing a whole new class, why not just write a function to parse the string and return a Fraction?

from fractions import Fraction

_MIXED_FORMAT = re.compile(r""""""

    (?P&lt;whole&gt;\d+)             # integer part
    \s+                        # whitespace
    (?P&lt;num&gt;\d+)               # numerator
    /(?P&lt;denom&gt;\d+)            # denominator
    \s*\Z                      # and optional whitespace to finish
"""""", re.VERBOSE)

        Fraction(3, 1)

    """"""
    m = _MIXED_FORMAT.match(s)
    if not m:
        return Fraction(s)
    d = m.groupdict()
    result = int(d['whole']) + Fraction(int(d['num']), int(d['denom']))
    if d['sign'] == '-':
        return -result
    else:
        return result

To format a fraction in mixed notation. But why not just write this as a function:

def format_mixed(f):
    """"""Format the fraction f as a (possibly) mixed fraction.

        &gt;&gt;&gt; all(format_mixed(mixed(f)) == f for f in ['1 2/3', '-3 4/5', '7/8'])
        True

    """"""
    if abs(f) &lt;= 1 or f.denominator == 1:
        return str(f)
    return '{0} {1.numerator}/{1.denominator}'.format(int(f), abs(f - int(f)))



The rest of your code seems unnecessary and complicated.

  How can I set the processor affinity of a process on Linux?  




Computer CPUs have many cores insde them nowadays.

I have always wondered if there is a way to, when I start a process on the Linux command line, specify which particular core or cores that process might use?

For example, can I start a massive grep task and say ""use ALL of CPU2 for yourself"".

Or could I start a find task and say ""never leave CPU3"".

Or maybe I could start a video decoding task and say ""use whatever is available on CPU1 and CPU2""

OR, is there no way to do this because it is not needed and the OS is doing this kind of stuff intelligently by itself (based on nice levels and general resource usage of the process etc)

7679,How can I speed up the rate at which putty dries?,"We're (slowly) renovating the sash windows in our house and the current window is causing problems. What should have been a quick job (especially at this time of year!) has turned into a marathon because the putty won't dry.

We had to replace a couple of panes of glass (one was cracked and we broke another when using a heat gun to remove the paint) so we knew it would take a little while. On a previous window the putty took over three weeks to dry enough to paint partly because (as we thought) there was too much oil. So this time we rolled the putty on newspaper first to try to remove the excess oil. It seemed to work, but after two weeks the putty is still soft to the touch.

We've tried standing the windows next to a radiator but all that seemed to do was make it softer (which was obviously going to happen in hindsight).

So given that we don't want to reputty the windows what can we do to speed up the drying process.

We've had to seal off the room and cover the window as best we can in the meantime.

I've found this advice on DoItYourself.com which doesn't really help as it says use other materials!

The answers to this post on DIY-Forums are confusing at best and possibly contradictory as one recommends exposing the putty to moisture(!) to speed the drying process.

",user120404,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/41188,"Here's a generic logic diagram for scanning a matrix keypad; I'll leave it up to you to translate it to your favorite implementation technology, which could be anything from SSI/MSI logic to a CPLD to part of an FPGA.







simulate this circuit &ndash; Schematic created using CircuitLab

This circuit scans the keys, one at a time, at a 1 kHz rate. When a key is pressed, the output of the multiplexer goes true and triggers U5. U5 is retriggerable, which means that its output remains true for as long as its input is true, plus another 10 ms or so after it goes false. This serves to debounce the keypresses. The QN output stops the scanning as long as a key is held down, and the Q output (data strobe) indicates to the external logic that the key location is available on the data out lines.

Ideally, you arrange the keys so that their locations are also the values you want them to represent; otherwise, use a lookup table to translate.

Note that U5 could be an analog multivibrator if you're using SSI/MSI logic; or it could be a digital counter driven by the 1 kHz clock if you're using a CPLD or FPGA.

",Rory,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/48536,"Two specific examples where a math education is important to computer science are:

1) Relational databases where relational calculus is used.


  Relational calculus consists of two calculi, the tuple relational
  calculus and the domain relational calculus, that are part of the
  relational model for databases and provide a declarative way to
  specify database queries. This in contrast to the relational algebra
  which is also part of the relational model but provides a more
  procedural way for specifying queries.
  
  The relational algebra might suggest these steps to retrieve the phone
  numbers and names of book stores that supply Some Sample Book:

Join book stores and titles over the BookstoreID.
Restrict the result of that join to tuples for the book Some Sample Book.
Project the result of that restriction over StoreName and StorePhone.

  
  The relational calculus would formulate a descriptive, declarative
  way:

Get StoreName and StorePhone for supplies such that there exists a title BK with the same BookstoreID value and with a BookTitle value of

  
  Some Sample Book.
  
  The relational algebra and the relational calculus are essentially
  logically equivalent: for any algebraic expression, there is an
  equivalent expression in the calculus, and vice versa. This result is
  known as Codd's theorem.

450,How are integers internally represented at a bit level in Java?,"I am trying to understand how Java stores integer internally. I know all java primitive integers are signed, (except short?). That means one less bit available in a byte for the number.

My question is, are all integers (positive and negative) stored as two's complement or are only negative numbers in two's complement?

I see that the specs says x bit two's complement number. But I often get confused.

For instance:

  int x = 15; // Stored as binary as is?  00000000 00000000 00000000 00001111?
  int y = -22; // Stored as two complemented value? 11111111 11111111 11111111 11101010


Edit

To be clear, x = 15 

   In binary as is: `00000000 00000000 00000000 00001111'
  Two's complement: `11111111 11111111 11111111 11110001`


So if your answer is  all numbers are stored as two's complement then:

  int x = 15; // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11110001
  int y = -22 // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11101010


The confusion here again is the sign says, both are negative numbers. May be I am misreading / misunderstanding it?

Edit
Not sure my question is confusing. Forced to isolate the question:

My question precisely: Are positive numbers stored in binary as is while negative numbers are stored as two's complement?

Some said all are stored in two's complement and one answer says only negative numbers are stored as two's complement.
",Kevin Rave,https://stackoverflow.com/users/668650,"Java integers are of 32 bits, and always signed. This means, the most significant bit (MSB) works as the sign bit. The integer represented by an int is nothing but the weighted sum of the bits. The weights are assigned as follows:

Bit#    Weight
31      -2^31
30       2^30
29       2^29
...      ...
2        2^2
1        2^1
0        2^0


Note that the weight of the MSB is negative (the largest possible negative actually), so when this bit is on, the whole number (the weighted sum) becomes negative.

Let's simulate it with 4-bit numbers:

Binary    Weighted sum            Integer value
0000       0 + 0 + 0 + 0           0
0001       0 + 0 + 0 + 2^0         1
0010       0 + 0 + 2^1 + 0         2
0011       0 + 0 + 2^1 + 2^0       3
0100       0 + 2^2 + 0 + 0         4
0101       0 + 2^2 + 0 + 2^0       5
0110       0 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 0       6
0111       0 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0     7 -&gt; the most positive value
1000      -2^3 + 0 + 0 + 0        -8 -&gt; the most negative value
1001      -2^3 + 0 + 0 + 2^0      -7
1010      -2^3 + 0 + 2^1 + 0      -6
1011      -2^3 + 0 + 2^1 + 2^0    -5
1100      -2^3 + 2^2 + 0 + 0      -4
1101      -2^3 + 2^2 + 0 + 2^0    -3
1110      -2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 0    -2
1111      -2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0  -1


So, the two's complement thing is not an exclusive scheme for representing negative integers, rather we can say that the binary representation of integers are always the same, we just negate the weight of the most significant bit. And that bit determines the sign of the integer.

In C, there is a keyword unsigned (not available in java), which can be used for declaring unsigned int x;. In the unsigned integers, the weight of the MSB is positive (2^31) rather than being negative. In that case the range of an unsigned int is 0 to 2^32 - 1, while an int has range -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.

From another point of view, if you consider the two's complement of x as ~x + 1 (NOT x plus one), here's the explanation:

For any x, ~x is just the bitwise inverse of x, so wherever x has a 1-bit, ~x will have a 0-bit there (and vice versa). So, if you add these up, there will be no carry in the addition and the sum will be just an integer every bit of which is 1.

For 32-bit integers:

x + ~x = 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111
x + ~x + 1 =   1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 + 1
           = 1 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000


The leftmost 1-bit will simply be discarded, because it doesn't fit in 32-bits (integer overflow). So,

x + ~x + 1 = 0
-x = ~x + 1


So you can see that the negative x can be represented by ~x + 1, which we call the two's complement of x.

Let's say I decided to be a bad boy and use a non-prime as my hashing function - take 12.

4833,What should I look for in a recording microphone for personal use?,"I was browsing through mics on Amazon and quickly realized I was out of my depth.  There are a couple closely related questions I am wondering about:


Are there different types of mics for (1) singing into at a concert, (2) singing into in a quiet room, and (3) picking up sound at more of a distance (e.g., singing and playing guitar and having both recorded with the one mic)?  What are they?
I'm most interested in a mic for case (3).  This is obviously not professional, I just want something with passable quality and not too much noise considering I'll be in a random room in a house or apartment.  What kind of things should I look for in a mic to achieve that?  What are the factors that most depend on price?  (If it's feasible I'd like to try to fit it into my $50 contest reward.)
There are a few terms I saw like ""moving coil"", ""condenser"", and ""dynamic"" that I saw used to describe mics.  If you could touch on these and any other relevant terminology that would be awesome.

",Matthew Read,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/28,"Guitar-and-vocal studio and live micing has been studied heavily, yet while there are a lot of recommendations, perhaps the foremost among them is ""experiment"". Now, that advice is generally aimed at the professional recording engineer or home studio enthusiast, with a locker full of microphones to choose from. Someone looking to buy their first mike, like yourself, is going to need a good way forward, so the mikes you buy will be well-suited to the task.

Probably the most common technique for studio recording of a guitar, because it's very simple, is to take one large-diaphragm side-address cardioid condenser microphone, like an AT4040 (about $300, well-known and respected among pros), and position it between 6 inches and a foot away from the guitar, pointed somewhere between the neck/body joint and the octave marker on the fretboard:



This is a single ""close-mic"" approach; it'll get you a bit of everything, from the actual strings' brightness to the deep resonance of the body chamber, to the sounds of you actually playing the thing, moving your hands and fingers around. You can experiment with exactly where the mic is; in the image, it's moved up in the direction of the neck, but still pointed at the neck/body joint. This gets the mic out of the way of the performer and anyone who may be watching his hands.

You can do the same thing with a small-diaphragm condenser as well, but the large-diaphragm will be more sensitive, so you can back it away and reduce the proximity effect and the amount of string noise, while still getting a sound that fills your ear instead of sounding like the microphone's all the way across the room.

Another very common technique is the XY-pair. This approach is designed to mimic the way your ears would hear the guitar if you stood in front of it. Same basic placement, but instead of one large-diaphragm condenser, use two small-diaphragm ""cigar mikes"", like Rode NT5s ($430 for a matched pair; generally well-liked in their price range though there are many others to choose from), arranged at 90* to each other and 45* offset from whatever you're pointing it at:



This arrangement is the most straightforward way to get a stereo recording of just about anything; one mike is your left ear, the other is your right, and there will be a natural amount of crossover between the two, which you can play with using the channels' pan knobs on the mixer to create a ""wide"" (""left"" mic panned hard left, ""right"" mic panned hard right) or ""narrow"" ( both mics close to center) stereo image.

The nice thing about either of these setups is that these mikes are just as good for the human voice as they are for guitar; they need to capture all the same frequencies in about the same overall balance, at about the same dynamic levels. So, once you have the mikes positioned well for the guitar, just start singing, and make minute adjustments as needed to get more or less of your voice. 

You can provide another condenser of just about any type (side-address, handheld, cigar) specifically for vocals. However, caveat soundman; first, the more mikes you have, the more effort you spend and the less success you have isolating their sound sources (the vocal mike will pick up some guitar and the guitar mike will pick up some vocals). Second, more mikes == more $$$. I'm recommending mikes that are expensive but a good value; you want these mikes, and not their cheaper lookalikes, but the money will mean that you get fewer of them, so I'm encouraging you to use fewer mikes for more purposes, instead of buying a cheap-sounding mike to point at everything you might ever want to record separately.

There are other, slightly more esoteric setups for micing. You may hear of the ""mid-side"" setup; it's one cardioid cigar mike pointed at the neck joint, with a second side-address mic with a ""figure-8"" pattern right underneath or behind it, with the travel of the diaphragm positioned parallel to the fretboard. The figure-8 pattern mic's signal is then split into two channels, one out-of-phase with the other, and when you bring it all back together in the mixer, the result is a stereo image that you can ""narrow"" or ""widen"" by adjusting the out-of-phase channel's fader. Other setups find ""sweet spots"" on the surface of the guitar's soundboard and close-mic them with cigar mikes, or seek to capture what the guitarist hears from his/her instrument with an ""over-the-shoulder"" mic (hey, if the guitar didn't sound good to you while you played it in the store, you wouldn't have bought it, right?), all very similar to approaches seen for other instruments.

Exactly what you want to do will determine the mics you will want to use to do it. Personally, I would go with a pair of cigar mikes, because they're extremely versatile; they can go places a larger mike can't, and you can point them at almost anything and get a good sound. Most of the common mic setups use at least one cigar mic. In addition, they're commonly used for all sorts of acoustic instrument recording, from guitars to solo strings and winds, and they also work well for drums. 

The side-address condenser would have many of the same purposes, but with only one mic, you're recording in mono; however, that same single mike would be better than the cigar mikes for solo voice in a studio environment, and many side-address mikes can be set to different response patterns such as cardioid, figure-8 or omni. So, if you want one single do-it-all for home recording, I'd choose a side-address.

Now, for live amplification, these same techniques won't be as useful; they may still work if you're careful, but a sensitive studio condenser mic will start giving you problems when you put it in the same room as the speakers hooked up to the mixer. Such is the nature of live sound; your subject is no longer sitting in an isolated, reverb-dampened booth, but on an open stage, with main and monitor speakers, and the walls of the venue, sending his sound right back at him. In these situations, usually a sound engineer's primary concern is getting the volume he needs out of the mains without feedback, and that means rejecting ""off-axis"" sound sources using narrower mic response patterns like cardioid/supercardioid, or less sensitive microphones like dynamic mikes or small-diaphragm condensers as compared to side-address mikes.

6264,Is the ability cost of the commander part of the color identity?,"Consider the card  Rhys the Exiled. Are you allowed to play black (and green) cards in your deck with this commander?

Or are you only allowed to play cards that are the same color as the commander's cost? If so, would this then make it impossible to use his ability?
",SirDuckduck,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/3616,"The colour identity of  Rhys the Exiled is Green and Black.

As per the Commander colour identity rules:


  A card's colour identity is its colour plus the colour of any mana symbols in the card's rules text.


The colour doesn't have to be just in the casting cost (which determines the card's colour), any mana symbol cost in the rules text counts towards the card's colour identity.

See also Comprehensive Rule 903.4: 


  903.4. The Commander variant uses color identity to determine what cards can be in a deck with a certain commander. The color identity of a card is the color or colors of any mana symbols in that card's mana cost or rules text, plus any colors defined by its characteristic-defining abilities (see rule 604.3) or color indicator (see rule 204).
  Example: Bosh, Iron Golem is a legendary artifact creature with mana cost {8} and the ability ""{3}{R}, Sacrifice an artifact: Bosh, Iron Golem deals damage equal to the sacrificed artifact's converted mana cost to target creature or player."" Bosh's color identity is red.

8163,Would a meta-answer be a good idea?,"One of the stated goals of the site was the have one comprehensive answer to each question. I think we can definitively say that it hasn't worked out that way. I think the reason is reputation. If one person answer the question with 40% of the information that a comprehensive answer would contain, and another with another 40% with 20% scattered among three other answers. Who's answer will get edited with the combined information and get the further upvotes? It just doesn't happen. People don't want to edit questions and mess with someone else's reputation (quite rightly, IMO - how would you feel getting a downvote for something added to your answer that you didn't write?).

One idea to get towards that goal would be to have a community answer on each question, with say a small reputation bump (2 points?) for participating in making it. To prevent reputation inflation, you can only get the 2 points from a given question one time, with a daily limit (say 10 points) for doing it on questions asked by others.

Then when the question is seen for posterity, it will be the first answer.

The issue is what to do with the accepted answer? One possibility is to only open the community answer once there is an accepted answer and pre-fill it with that answer.

Does any of this make sense to anyone else?
",Yishai,https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/130225,"My goodness, what fortuitous timing.  I'd been thinking about asking about this very thing.

Besides parsing HTML and working with datetimes, the most frequent question in php seems to be about the mail function.  For the uninitiated, the built-in mailing function is terribly unreliable and provides no feedback when things go wrong.  Combine this with the average quality of shared hosting, and it's no wonder why we get so many questions about sending mail through PHP.

Thankfully there is a known, finite set of solutions to these mailing problems. Many are solved by the various anti-spam techniques documented on Jeff Atwood's well-known blog post about mail deliverability.  Many are solved by using one of a handful of modern third-party mailing libraries instead of the built-in function.

Because there are so many duplicates, it's hard to actually find a good enough duplicate to suggest a closure.  So I was thinking that writing a definitive guide covering the most frequent problems might serve a worthwhile purpose.

Such things have been tried before, like ""Reference - What does this symbol mean in PHP?"", but with mixed success.

I think that spreading the word that such a resource exists might be problematic, followed closely by making sure that questions actually get closed as duplicates when they fit the pattern.  While knowledge would spread slowly throughout frequent contributors, I'm actually far more worried about dupe closures.  Some users don't care for having their questions closed as dupes, and some users think that they are special snowflakes that are totally asking a different question for which the answer is still the same.  (The answer being that mail() sucks and you shouldn't use it except as a last resort.)

But if you are explicitly coding for SSL handshake, client application is responsible for selecting the keystore, and presenting the certificate as part of the handshake.

Since it is working in a previous version of Glassfish, the same code should work for you. It is very likely that your problem is related to configuration.

That is a bad practice you have to throw originally thrown exception to upper level then you can handle the Exception there.

8391,Splicing tiny wire inside broken mouse cable,"I don't know a lot about electronics repairs, but I've got a relatively expensive laser mouse that got a frayed connection on the wire:



I'm wanting to repair it as it's out of warranty.  I've cut the cable on either side of the ""stopper"", isolated each of the individual wires, and stripped the ends off in preparation for splicing.



I've read some instructions that indicate I should do an inline wrap and then apply some solder.  

Is there a better way for wires this small?

Is there a particular type of heat shrink wrap I should put on this after it's spliced?  Or will electrical tape suffice?



Inside the mouse, the cable is connected to a little plug.  To me, it looks a lot like the fan plugs inside a PC.  It's got 5 pins each 1mm apart.  If there were a replacement plug I could buy and crimp the wires into, that'd be great!


",James Kolpack,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/7046,"I disagree with Chris in that you don't just want to shorten the cable.  It's not the length of cable I'm worried about, but that tiny connector you don't want to replicate.  The connector and the wires immediately coming out of it look to be intact.  Replacing that will be a major pain in the butt, so I'd go to reasonable length to preserve that piece.

Since that piece is now short, you'll have to make a splice.  Just realize up front you're not going to make a splice in such small cable that is anything like the size of the cable.  The splice will be big, fat, and ugly in comparison.  It looks like it can be made to serve as the strain relief too, so that helps a little.

To splice such tiny wires, see if you can sortof stick the stranded ends into each other.  That may take some persuasion under a magnifying light, and then some weighty objects on your bench to hold them in place while you solder.  This won't be easy, but it should be doable.  If that just isn't practical, give up and bend each wire into a U and hook the two U ends together, flatten them together with a needlenose, then solder.

Once you have the connections made, wrap each one individually in a small piece of electrical tape, then wrap the whole bundle in electrical tape so that is looks like one fat section of cable.  Like I said, big, fat, and ugly, but it should work.  All that tape will act like a strain relief, so that section shouldn't break again.

3828,Do parallel realities take precedence over time travel in the Star Trek Universe?,"The 2009 Star Trek movie and its pending sequels are based on the concept of parallel realities introduced in the season 7 Next Generation episode ""Parallels,"" laying out that anything that could happen has happened in a parallel universe. The Enterprise and its crew from the most recent movie are part of a parallel reality that was created when Nero and Spock came back through the black hole created by red matter in an attempt to stem the destruction caused by a supernova. For clarification, this crew will be referred to as Chris Pine's and the older movies as Shatner's.

In the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, a probe shows up in 2286 at Earth looking for whales that had disappeared decades before. Shatner's crew is faced with travelling back in time to try and retrieve two humpback whales in order to stop the cylindrical probe from destroying Earth. They do this using a Klingon Bird-of-Prey that was stolen in the previous movie, going back to 1986 to find the whales.

I think it's safe to assume that in Pine's reality, the probe will probably make an appearance again, since the destruction of whales probably wouldn't change. So Pine's crew will also be faced with the dilemma of travelling back to find humpbacks (although probably without using a Klingon ship).

If Pine's crew also goes back to the same instant in 1986 as Shatner's crew to find whales (which seems highly improbable given that hitting the same time period as Shatner would be ridiculous), would they run into Shatner's crew or would it create another parallel reality stemming from 1986? If it created another reality, that seems like some kind of backwards causality since the event that would be causing the new stem wouldn't be the instant before the ships arrived but an event in the future. Would time travel trump the parallel universe and both Kirks would be there at the same time?
",SocioMatt,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/6244,"I'm not sure if this is actually a parallel reality or a new timeline. The difference between the two I must admit goes over my head right now. However there is two main differences in the Pine Line (I'm coining that phrase) one events have been changed drastically; technology is more advanced and with the destruction of Vulcan certain elements of stories will not play out the same. That being said you are right the Entity that speaks whale is most likely sure to return which brings me to the second point. Old Spock is there and knows all about this.

I can't find a date for the whales extinction but if they are still around I'm sure he will make a priority of saving them. If they are not he knows advanced technology and will be able to give ample warning to the Pine Line to prepare and maybe even bring back the whales from the past. After all the Earth was under attack last time which is why the Shatner Line was saved by the Enterprise crew who were on exile on the planet Vulcan which is no more.

One of the advantages of the Pine Line is that it actually gets to retell the story without dismissing the original fan loved series or movies. However many things are changed and Nimoy Spock can be sort of a McGuffin used to fix or explain away serious consistences such as what will happen when the whales come.

8195,"On surjections, idempotence and axiom of choice","The following assertion is trivial in ZFC, or even in much weaker theories. Is it also true in ZF?

(I couldn't find it in the Consequences site so far.)


  If $A$ is an infinite set such that $A$ can be mapped onto $A\times 2$ then $|A\times 2|=|A|$


The problem is that we cannot necessarily choose from every fiber of $f$, so we cannot construct an injection from $A$ to $f^{-1}(A\times\lbrace 0\rbrace)$, which will prove the assertion.

While I'm on the topic, is it possible for a D-finite set to have such property? It is possible for a D-finite set to be surjected onto a larger set than itself, but what about that large?
",Asaf Karagila,https://mathoverflow.net/users/7206,"This is only a partial answer, but it's way too long to go in the comments.  I'll describe a permutation model (of ZF with atoms) that seems to give a counterexample $A$ for your statement.  It will be easy to see that $A$ maps onto $A\times2$, but I haven't proved that there's no bijection between $A$ and $A\times2$; all I can say is that it looks quite plausible.  If the example is correct, it will automatically transfer to ZF (without atoms) by the Jech-Sochor theorem.  So here's the model.

Start with a set $U$ of atoms in 1-1 correspondence with the product $2^\omega\times3$ of the Cantor set and the ordinal 3.  I'll write [x,i] for the atom that corresponds to the pair $(x,i)$, where $x\in2^\omega$ and $i\in3$.   Let $G$ be the group of those permutations of $U$ that leave the first component (in the Cantor set) of each atom unchanged.  So $G$ is the direct product of continuum-many copies of the symmetric group $S_3$.  To define the class of supports, let me first introduce the terminology ""thread"" for an $\omega$-sequence of atoms $[x_n,i_n]$ such that, for each $n$, $x_{n+1}$ is obtained from $x_n$ by deleting the first bit, i.e., $x_{n+1}(k)=x_n(k+1)$.  Let the supports be those subsets of $U$ that are covered by finitely many threads.  This choice of supports (along with the choice of $U$ and $G$) determines a permutation model $M$.

In $M$, let $A$ be the set of all the threads.  There is a surjection from $A$ to $A\times 2$, namely the map that sends any thread $T$ to the pair $(T',b)$ where $T'$ is obtained from $T$ by deleting its first term, say $[x_0,i_0]$, and $b=x_0(0)$.  (So $b$ is the one component in the real $x_0$ that is omitted when one forms $x_1$.)  This surjection is exactly 3 to 1, as it essentially just ""forgets"" the $i_0$ from $T$.  

I believe, but have not proved, that $M$ contains no injection from $A\times2$ into $A$.  The idea of the proof would be to assume there is such an injection, fix a finite number of threads that support it, and then look at what the injection could do with threads $T$ whose $x_0$ has no tail in common with anything from the support.

I further believe that the model would also work if I had used 2 instead of 3, but that the missing part of the proof will be easier with 3.  The point is that, with 2, each thread would support the ""complementary"" thread, consisting of the same reals $x_n$ but the other elements $i_n$ in 2. It would also support various ""mixtures"" of itself and the complementary thread.   With 3, a thread should support no threads other than itself and truncations of itself.

Going even further out on a limb, I also believe that the model would work if, instead of the whole Cantor space $2^\omega$, I used only the subspace consisting of the eventually periodic sequences of 0's and 1's and required threads also to be eventually periodic.  In this model, $A$ should be Dedekind-finite, thus answering the last part of your question.

",Malka S,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/30189,"However long it takes for Google to find them and then process them. 

Google crawls different websites at different rates. This website is crawled constantly. New pages show up in Google's index in seconds. So links found on this page are available to Google's algorithm almost immediately. Pages on a personal website that has few links and little content will be crawled infrequently so links on those pages will not be found by Google for weeks or months. 

Google supposedly is constantly running its ranking algorithm so theoretically as links are found they should have an effect on a web page's rankings. But who really knows how often ranking calculations are performed? Plus who knows when data is actually factored into a rankings calculation? It may vary like crawl rate does. 

So the answer is: it depends and varies a lot.

8316,How to deploy OSGi bundle to Maven repo with deploy:deploy-file?,"I have an OSGi bundle that was built using Maven by another team. The POM file declares its packaging as ""bundle"" and uses the Apache Felix plugin.

I need to deploy this artifact to a local Maven repository (Nexus) so that it can be used by our internal projects.

I have used the deploy:deploy-file target to deploy the bundle to the repository, just as you would with a standard JAR file and this works without error. I extracted the embedded POM from the bundle and passed that on the command line, so the command line was:

mvn deploy:deploy-file -Dfile=3rdpartybundle.jar -DpomFile=pom.xml -DrepositoryId=internal -Durl=http://internalserver/nexus


The issue is that when I deploy it like this, the packaging is set to bundle and as a result the name of the artifact in the repository ends up with a .bundle extension, instead of a .jar extension.

Now, we cannot figure out how to declare it as a dependency. If we declare it like this:

        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;...&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;...&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;...&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;type&gt;bundle&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;


We get an error stating that the dependency cannot be resolved. The interesting thing is that the GAV coordinates in the error message actually has ""jar"" as the value for the type of the dependency even though we set it as ""bundle"".

If we change the dependency to:

        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;...&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;...&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;...&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;type&gt;jar&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;


We get the exact same unresolved dependency error.

So how are you supposed to deploy an artifact packaged as a bundle to a Maven repository, so that it can be used as a compile time dependency for another project?

2) Try using  mvn deploy:deploy-file with -DgeneratePom=false -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/3rdpartybundle.jar but without specifying -DpomFile= - hope there's no META-INF/maven/pom.xml inside the 3rdpartybundle.jar - it should work using this but you'll need to specify the groupId/artifactId/version parameters as these won't be derived from the project's pom.

I know I've build bundle artifacts in the past and deployed these to our nexus (v1.9.0.1) and those in the Spring repo are typed bundle too, but don't recall any issue. (Incidentally you don't need to specify the bundle in dependency declarations, AFAIK if it's the only artifact it should be inferred)

Players have to make tough choices, especially since turn order is so important in Power Grid.  The player in the lead goes last when buying resources.

7271,Scatterplots for subsets of multivariate data [Updated],"Update/Re-write

There has been a lot of ambiguity over what i'm am trying to do with this question so I have decided to give it a full rewrite. I'm really sorry for the confusion. If you want to see the background please see the edit history. I hope things are clearer now..

I have some data made up into the following fashion:

datac =
  {
   data1 = RandomReal[1, {7, 3}],
   data2 = RandomReal[1, {13, 3}],
   data3 = RandomReal[1, {19, 3}],
   data4 = RandomReal[1, {16, 3}],
   data5 = RandomReal[1, {5, 3}]
   };


data1 through data5 are subsets of a multivariate dataset with 3 independent variables. data1, for example, is composed of 7 individual data points (each with 3 variables).

If I use the following function: 

Needs[""StatisticalPlots`""]
pairwisecol[data_, col_] := 
PairwiseScatterPlot[data, 
                      PlotStyle -&gt; col, 
                      DataTicks -&gt; True,  
                      DataLabels -&gt; {""x"", ""y"", ""z""}]


I can create a combined plot comparing the various subsets. E.g.

Show[{pairwisecol[data1, Red], 
      pairwisecol[data2, Blue], 
      pairwisecol[data3, Green],  
      pairwisecol[data4, Purple], 
      pairwisecol[data5, Orange]}]




This curently has the major drawbacks that each subset has to be defined and have a colour explicitly assigned to it. Also, Show in this instance overlays all of the DataTicks etc, rather than just the elements from the first plot (as is normally the case with Show[{Plot1,Plot2}]).

What I'm looking for is a way to use the whole (partitioned) dataset datac to generate such a plot/diagram. i.e. something like,

Show[pairwisecol[#, Red] &amp; /@ datac]


but, with Red being replaced by a series of colours to represent each subset (like in the plot shown).

...Alternatively, starting with a 2-level list e.g.

datap = RandomReal[1, {60, 3}];


and a definition of sublist partitions,

parts = {7, 13, 19, 16, 5};


or

partspos = {[[1;;7]], [[8;;20]], [[21;;39]], [[40;;55]], [[56;;60]]};


then defining a function something like:

pairwiseP[data_, partlist_] := ...


that would partition datap into appropriate sublists, create a series of PairwiseScatterPlot's (each with a different plot colour) and then combine them using Show. 

Note that this example has n = 3 independent variables. I am looking for a method that works for 1 &lt; n &lt; ~20.

Can anyone suggest how to do this?
",geordie,https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/4626,"I'm still uncertain whether this is what you want.  Just make an array of plots and wrap it in Grid.  Fiddle with the options to get axes, dividers, etc. the way you want them.

The way I understand it, the data is really four subsets, each a group of datasets.  For each group, you want to plot one group vs. another group, for each pair of groups, data[[1, All, i ]] vs data[[1, All, j ]].  I'm still unsure about the desired coloring.  I've colored the plots by subset (which gives no extra information, except colors are pretty :).  The question states


  The individual colouring of the subsets is what i'm aiming for.


In the example plot, there are mixed colors.  I can only think that the plot is an amalgamation of subsets.  With my current understanding of the question, I don't how to use color to add more to each plot.  I feel like I'm missing something here.



Some random data with some structure:

SeedRandom[1];
data1 = Map[(# + RandomReal[{-0.1, 0.1}, 3])^Range[3] &amp;, RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {4, 4}], {-1}];
Dimensions[data1]


Plotting functions:

colorFn[subset_] := Hue[subset/4];
plot[subset_, datasets_] := Graphics[{colorFn[subset], Point[#]},
          AspectRatio -&gt; 1/GoldenRatio, ImageSize -&gt; 100] &amp; /@ datasets;


Mapping the plotting functions:

Grid[
 MapIndexed[plot[First@#2, Thread /@ Subsets[Transpose[#], {2}]] &amp;, data1],
 Dividers -&gt; All]




It's more interesting with 40 points instead of 4:

SeedRandom[1];
data1 = Map[(# + RandomReal[{-0.1, 0.1}, 3])^Range[3] &amp;, RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {4, 40}], {-1}];

Grid[
 MapIndexed[plot[First@#2, Thread /@ Subsets[Transpose@#, {2}]] &amp;, data1],
 Dividers -&gt; All]






Just to show the data is being processed as indicated:

foo = MapIndexed[Thread /@ Subsets[Transpose@#, {2}] &amp;, data1];
foo[[1, 1]] == Transpose@{data1[[1, All, 1]], data1[[1, All, 2]]}
foo[[1, 2]] == Transpose@{data1[[1, All, 1]], data1[[1, All, 3]]}
foo[[1, 3]] == Transpose@{data1[[1, All, 2]], data1[[1, All, 3]]}

",gablin,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/2634,"As mentioned by others in the comments, you an use \path to update the current relative position.  ++(…) is relative to the last saved position within a particular path, but the start of a path is relative to (0,0). Consider the following example:

1341,Understanding the definition of the order of an entire function,"Let $f: \mathbb C \to \mathbb C$ be an entire function. The order of $f$ is defined by $$\lambda=\limsup_{r \to \infty} \frac{\log \log M(r)}{\log r}, $$ where $$M(r)=\max_{|z|=r} |f(z)| .$$

The author claims that


  ""According to this definition $\lambda$ is the smallest number such that
      $$M(r)\leq e^{r^{\lambda+\varepsilon}} $$ for any given $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ as soon as $r$ is sufficiently large.""


Why is this true?

My attempt:

We know that $$\lambda=\lim_{\rho \to \infty} \sup_{r \geq \rho} \frac{\log \log M(r)}{\log r}. $$

From the definition of the limit we have that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists some $\rho_0&gt;0$, such that $$\left\lvert \sup_{r \geq \rho} \frac{\log \log M(r)}{\log r}-\lambda \right\rvert \leq \varepsilon ,$$ for every $\rho \geq \rho_0$. In other words $$\frac{\log \log M(r)}{\log r} \leq \lambda+\varepsilon $$ for every $r \geq \rho_0$. From here it is easy to see that $$M(r)\leq e^{r^{\lambda+\varepsilon}}, $$ for all $r \geq \rho_0$. I cannot see why $\lambda$ is the smallest number with this property.

Thanks in advance.
",user1337,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/62839,"Note that

$$F(\rho) = \sup_{r \geqslant \rho} \frac{\log\log M(r)}{\log r}$$

is a non-increasing function of $\rho$, hence $\lim\limits_{\rho\to\infty} F(\rho) = \inf\limits_{\rho &gt; R} F(\rho).$

By the definition of the limes superior, for every $\mu &lt; \lambda$, with $\varepsilon = \frac{\lambda-\mu}{3}$ there are arbitrarily large radii $r$ with

$$\frac{\log \log M(r)}{\log r} &gt; \lambda - \varepsilon = \mu + 2\varepsilon,$$

and that inequality is equivalent to

$$M(r) &gt; e^{r^{\mu+2\varepsilon}},$$

so for every $\mu &lt; \lambda$, there is an $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, such that there is no $\rho_0$ with

$$M(r) \leqslant e^{r^{\mu+\varepsilon}}$$

for all $r \geqslant \rho_0$, indeed

$$M(r)e^{-r^{\mu+\varepsilon}}$$ is unbounded for all small enough $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ then.

Since I don't know the exact centre of the propeller, that's what the for loop before the rotation is for. It finds the average of the y and z co-ordinates.

After I find it, I translate to -y,-z , rotate it, and then translate back. This makes the propeller spin as I want it to, but it also rotates along the origin >.&lt;

Ok, I showed that $k(x)$ is irreducible since it it a quadratic and has no linear factors.

A field constructed with $k(x)$ would have order $11^2=121$...and so the multiplicative group would have $120$ elements. If $x$ generates this group under multiplication modulo $k(x)$, then I would know that $k(x)$ is primitive. However, I would have to calculate $x^1,x^2,...,x^{120}$ to show this...

I figured that it would be ridiculous for a question like this to result in $k(x)$ being primitive, but what if it were? Would I really have to calculate $x^1,x^2,...,x^{120}$ in order to demonstrate this? Is there a much more efficient way of solving a problem like this?
",Bobby Lee,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/122106,"A quadratic polynomial $k(x)\in\Bbb{Z}_{11}[x]$ is primitive, iff the (multiplicative) order of the coset
$$
\alpha=x+\langle k(x)\rangle
$$
in the field $\Bbb{Z}_{11}[x]/\langle k(x)\rangle=\Bbb{F}_{121}$ is $120$. By Lagrange's theorem the order is always a factor of $120$. Thus it is one of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,20,24,30,40,60,120\}$. To speed up checking you can furthermore make the  observation that if $\alpha^{120/p}\neq1$ for all prime factors $p$ of $120$ (s0 $p=2,3$ or $5$), then the order has to be maximal, i.e. $\alpha$ is a primitive element (or $k(x)$ is a primitive polynomial). Of course, it may turn out that $\alpha$ is not primitive, in which case you will see evidence of this at some point.

In this task square-and-multiply is your friend. Do remember to use the equation
$$
k(\alpha)=0\Longleftrightarrow\alpha^2=-(2\alpha+2)=9\alpha+9
$$
in each step.
For example
$$
\begin{array}{rll}
\alpha^2&amp;=&amp;=-(2\alpha+2)\\
\alpha^4&amp;=(\alpha^2)^2=(2\alpha+2)^2=4\alpha^2+8\alpha+4&amp;=7
\end{array}
$$
I stop here, because we see that something slightly unexpected happened: $\alpha^4$ belongs to the prime field $\Bbb{Z}_{11}$. At this point I reveal that you can answer the question about primitivity simply by calculating the order of $7$ in the prime field. Leaving that to you!

With 20/20 hindsight we can see that the result about $\alpha^4$ is a consequence of the factorization (in $\Bbb{Z}_{11}[x]$ or actually already in $\Bbb{Z}[x]$)
$$
x^4+4=(x^4+4x^2+4)-4x^2=(x^2+2)^2-(2x)^2=(x^2+2x+2)(x^2-2x+2)

265,Why is the pixel count of RAW images from the Panasonic LX5 slightly larger than the generated JPEGs?,"I'm new to working with RAW images, and I'm capturing simultaneous RAW+JPGs with my new Lumix LX5, and using Bibble to view/process the results.

I'm very surprised that the RAW images taken at 24mm wide 16x9 seem to capture a different (and larger) sensor area compared to the JPGs. The RAW images seem to contain the equivalent of about 100 extra pixels on left and right sides, and a smaller number top and bottom. I say ""equivalent"", because the actual pixel counts of RAW and JPG are only slightly different, which implies some resizing must be going on...?

JPG: 3968 x 2232
RAW: 3976 x 2238

I guess this small difference is because JPG images must be 16x16 multiples>

The raw image displays noticeable vignetting in the extra pixels, and there's a fair bit of chromatic aberration. I can crop off the 'extra' pixels, but then my RAW image has fewer pixels in it than the JPG, which doesn't feel right. 

I'll try and add samples shortly.
",Roddy,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/562,"I think this is happening because Bibble (at least the version you're using) isn't applying the metadata in the LX5's RW2 file that tells it how to correct for the lens' deformations. Perhaps this is a setting in Bibble, or a missing feature in their RW2 converter. I'll bet if you convert your RW2's to DNG with Adobe's free DNG converter, Bibble be able to read and apply that data and produce a 'corrected' image. 

I've come to this conclusion (and found your question) by noticing the same artifacts you mentioned when using Picasa 3.8 to view images created using Adobe DNG Converter 6.4.0.139 from my LX5's RAW files. This happens when I ask Adobe DNG Converter to create files for ""Camera Raw 5.4 and later"", the max setting. This theory was backed up by the fact that the JPG preview looks corrected when compared to the image rendered by Picasa when it renders the DNG. Not only that, but the JPG preview rendered by Adobe DNG converter matches the JPG's that came straight from the camera for the same shot (clearly the converter is applying the same transformations that the camera did internally to make the JPG).

After playing around a bit, I discovered that the artifacts go away in Picasa 3.8 when I have the DNG Converter create files for ""Camera Raw 4.6 and later"". I assume this means Picasa 3.8 doesn't understand Camera Raw 5.4, but it CAN understand Camera Raw 4.6, and will apply the correction automatically to conforming DNG files. No more corner vignette and barrel distortion on the resulting DNG files in Picasa, and in theory all the information from the RW2 is in the DNG!

Also - I wouldn't be put off by the correction - it's a good thing - and supposedly no information is thrown away. The DNG / RW2 files contain the raw sensor data plus additional information on the lens / camera aberrations, and viewing software can elect to apply these transformations or not. The 'true' sensor data can always be accessed.

",onmyway133,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/27111,"Because when one name is used to identify someone you do not personally know, the convention has long been to use their surname.

Not:


  William wrote The Tempest. Winston was prime minister of the UK when it was at war with Adolf. George was the the first president of the US. Albert developed the theory of relativity. Mary wrote Frankenstein.


Among other things, the most common first names are probably more common than the most common surnames:

Asking a search engine for suggestions brought me to the music section of stackexchange and particulary to this question. After some thought I am planning to buy the Kaossilator 2 becase I feel/think:


it is not too expensive for me (less than 200$) (otherwise I would have fancied a Teenage engineering OP1;
it can be completely silent (commuting home->work->home takes quite a long time, I would like to be able to practice in crowded places (without annoying anyone);
it is extremely portable (for the above commuting);
it can be played even without being plugged to a pc (otherwise I would have chosen this korg nano keyboard);
it can study some music theory with it;
in some six months I will be able to show some decent performance with it (so to say, I hope it has a bit of depth and is not just a toy).


Since (as I said), I know nothing of music and musical instruments, I would like to have someone savvy to 'validate' my points; alternative suggestions/idead would be appreciated, too!

6506,What is the cardinality of the family of unlabelled bipartite graphs on n vertices?,"I have attempted to calculate the number of unlabelled bipartite graphs as follows:


  Let $G = (V_1, V_2, E)$ be a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with $|V_1| = m$ and $|V_2| = n-m$. Assume without loss of generality that $|V_1| \leq |V_2|$ so $m \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor$. If $G$ is complete bipartite then it has $m(n-m)$ edges since each of the vertices in $V_1$ is connected to each in $V_2$. Thus, the total number of bipartite graphs with parts of size $m$ and $n-m$ is $2^{m(n-m)}$. In order to find the total number of possible bipartite graphs on $n$ vertices we sum over all possible $m$:
  \begin{align}
\sum^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}_{m=1} 2^{m(n-m)}
\end{align}


However, I notice that I have counted labelled bipartite graphs where I need the number of unlabelled graphs. I'm struggling to see how to account for this.
",Andrew,https://mathoverflow.net/users/31128,"It seems that what Andrew wants to count are what are called in enumerative contexts
""bicolored graphs"". A bicolored graph is a graph in which the vertices have been colored black and white so that every edge joins two vertices of different colors. A bipartite (or bicolorable) graph is a graph that has a bicoloring. A bicolorable graph with $k$ connected components has $2^k$ bicolorings. (In nonenumerative contexts the distinction between bipartite and bicolored is usually unimportant.) In addition, in counting  bicolored graphs one might or might not consider switching the two colors to give an equivalent graph. All of the versions of the enumeration problem have been solved. Counting unlabeled bicolored graphs (with no color-switching equivalence) is a straightforward application of Burnside's lemma; counting unlabeled bipartite graphs is tricky. 

It's not too hard to find appropriate references by searching MathSciNet. (Hint: ""color"" is sometimes spelled ""colour"".)

Incidentally, the number of labeled bicolored graphs on $n$ vertices is 
$$\sum_{m=0}^n 2^{m(n-m)}\binom{n}{m}.$$

I wanted to take advantage of the fact the lists were sorted, but I fear my efforts only served to render my code convoluted and inefficient. What do you think?
",Legato,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/49181,"First of all, I have to say that the code formatting is very clean. It's been a long while since I read such well-formatted code. It's probably even cleaner than my own code, and definitely cleaner than my apartment.

It is good to take advantage of the specification that the inputs are sorted. Overall you have done so nicely, but I have a few comments.

int[] foo, int[] bar


Please, oh please, no such variable names! I would prefer input1 and input2 or something like that. foo and bar are names which is okay to use in example code, but not in actual code like this.

The choice of choosing a Set&lt;Integer&gt; to store the results is not that optimal when you want the end result as a String. Here I would definitely go for StringBuilder, which also saves you the handling of an edge-case. In fact, I believe your current handling of intersection.isEmpty() isn't necessary either, as an empty set will have the toString value {} which thanks to your substring call will be converted to an empty string.

StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    ...
        if (result.length() &gt; 0) {
            result.append(',');
        }
        result.append(bar[j++]);
    ...
return result.toString();


Also, this part can be simplified:

if (foo[i] &lt; bar[j]) {
    continue;
} else {
    intersection.add(bar[j++]);
}


to:

if (foo[i] &gt;= bar[j]) {
    intersection.add(bar[j++]);
}


Although you probably would want to check for == instead of &gt;= there.

What's the maximum will a soldier can have at each rank up?

Bonus questions: how likely is a soldier to get the maximum will increase when ranking up? What about high rank soldiers that come as mission rewards?
",kotekzot,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/19827,"All rookie soldiers start with 40 Will and gain Will increases as they gain ranks.  They suffer a decrease in Will when they suffer a critical wound in battle.  Therefore, there isn't really a single low number to worry about, as it varies by each rank.  Also, a Squaddie (or any other low ranked soldier) who has been critically wounded can eventually gain enough Will back to be a successful soldier.

The table below shows the low and high Will values a soldier can have, by rank.  By checking each soldier against the table, you can determine if their will is too low for the rank they have.  I've included the low and high Will values for when the Iron Will upgrade has been purchased.  However, I'm not certain how helpful those will be, as you generally purchase that upgrade after your soldiers have been promoted a few times, so you won't expect to see values as high as the columns indicate.

I created the table using the following assumptions:


Each soldier gets a fixed +2 per level.
Each soldier gets a random +1d6 per level (iRandWillIncrease=6 in the ini file).
Each soldier gets another fixed +2 per level when the Iron Will upgrade is purchased (iBaseOTSWillIncrease=2 in the ini file).
Each soldier gets another random +1d4 per level when the Iron Will upgrade is purchased (iRandOTSWillIncrease=4 in the ini file).


(See http://wiki.tesnexus.com/index.php/XCOM:EU_DefaultGameCore.ini_settings for the ini values.)

                        Iron Will
Rank        L   H       L   H
Rookie      40  40      40  40

Major       58  88      76  124 
Colonel     61  96      82  138


The Second Wave options Not Created Equally and Hidden Potential change all of this.  Not Created Equally changes the starting Will from a fixed 40 to a random number between 25-60.  Will increases stay the same.  Hidden Potential changes the Will increases (and all other stat increases) to be random, so there will be a much larger variation of Will values among your soldiers.  The above table can still be used to check whether you have a soldier who is better or worse than ""normal"", though.

1625,Does the a gasoline or diesel engine appy fuel at high speeds when not pressing the pedal and more,"Let say I directly connect a small engine to my bicycle, and that I'm superman who can overcome any force.
Then I start cycling (using my legs...) - the engine starts to rotate, even though I haven't ""started it"" using the switch.

Does it mean that if I press the pedal (or whatever) of the engine, it will apply force? Either on a diesel or a gasoline engine.

Another question: Lets say I'm driving down a hill in a relatively high speed in a car, and I'm not pressing the gas pedal at all. Does the engine burn fuel at all, in both diesel and gas? If I (while in gear) turn off the engine, will something actually happen? If I would press the pedal after turning it off (while it still rotates) - will it apply force? (in both diesel and gas).

If, while driving, I disconnected the idler (i.e the engine won't apply any force if I'm not pressing the pedal at any RPM and pressing the clutch will take it to zero RPM) and press the brake until I get to a complete stop, will the engine ""stall""? If I'm doing it in a hill facing down, after releasing the brakes I'd accelerate and the engine would gain RPMs, will it be able to continue applying force?

Finally: What's the difference between a ""running engine"" and one thats not running, assuming both are rotating?

I'm sorry if I'm asking too much so if you would at least explain the principle I'd be very happy. Thank you!
",Mark Segal,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/3112,"I will explain it for an EFI engine with a manual transmission because it might not be as straight forward with a carbureted engine or automatic.

For ease of explaining this I will consider the engine as ""on"" whenever the ignition switch is set to the ""on"" state. This means that the ECU is on and is monitoring the engine state and controlling it's behavior. 

For the bicycle example with an EFI engine if you had your ""ignition"" to on while you started cycling then the ecu would start to inject fuel and cause spark so yes it would apply force and use fuel. If the ignition were off then the ecu would be off and you wouldn't get any fuel or spark so no you won't get any force if you apply the accelerator.

Going downhill not pressing the accelerator with the ignition on will use significantly less fuel (not sure if the ecu uses zero fuel though) and the engine will still be sparking for sure. If you were to turn the ignition to accessory while coasting downhill the ecu will shut off and you will stop injecting fuel and stop spark as well so the accelerator would no longer do anything.

If you have the clutch in and you stop the engine will stop. If you then release the brakes and roll down a hill then one of two things will happen.

1) if your ecu is on (ingition on) then the engine will start to use fuel and spark. (It will be really rough until it gets to ~700rpm)
2) if your ecu is off then the engine will rotate but no fuel or spark so therefore no acceleration.

Finally the difference between a running engine and not if they are both spinning :

A running engine is one which can continue to run from the energy it is producing without an external force. Modern engines require fuel air and spark to satisfy this requirement. eg. ECU on and rotating

An engine is off if when all external forces are removed then engine would stop. eg. the ecu is off so the engine isn't producing any of its own power and is only spinning because it is connected to wheels that are being accelerated by gravity.

Hope this clarifies it somewhat....

Because .validate() is only the initialization method of the plugin, it is not the testing method.  The .validate() method only gets called once on DOM ready to initialize the plugin with your rules &amp; options.  All subsequent calls are ignored.

824,Prove that any real function defined on a real open interval has at most countably many simple discontinuities.,"This is problem 17 in baby Rudin's chapter on continuity. He has a hint to use triplets of rationals that bound each simple discontinuity on the left, right, and in between the values of the limits from the left and right. It seems like this can be weakened to just rationals to the left and right. 

Simple discontinuities are those in which the limit from the left and right exist, so there must be intervals to the left and right of a simple continuity on which no other simple discontinuity can exist. More precisely, let $c$ and $c'$ be simple discontinuities for $f$ on $(a,b)$ and consider the limit, $l$, of $f$ approaching $c$ from the left:

$\forall \epsilon &gt;0, \exists \delta&gt;0 : c-x&lt;\delta \Rightarrow |l-f(x)|&lt;\epsilon$

but $ \exists \epsilon '&gt;0 \forall \delta ' &gt;0 : |c'-x|&lt;\delta ' \Rightarrow |f(c')-f(x)|&gt;\epsilon '
\\ \therefore \epsilon = \epsilon ' , \delta ' = \delta \rightarrow \leftarrow
$

Therefore, you can make an injection from the set of simple discontinuities to a subset of rationals by associating each simple discontinuity with one rational in the aforementioned ""free"" interval to its left; from there compose with the map from rationals to integers to show countable. Is this argument correct?
",user2303321,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/84960,"
  so there must be intervals to the left and right of a simple continuity on which no other simple discontinuity can exist.


That is incorrect. Consider an enumeration $r_n$ of the rationals, and let

$$f(x) = \sum_{\substack{n \in \mathbb{N}\\r_n &lt; x}} 2^{-n}.$$

Then $f$ is a strictly monotonic function that has a jump discontinuity in every rational number.

However, as the points of discontinuity approach any fixed $y \in \mathbb{R}$, the jumps tend to $0$, in fact, the sum of all jumps in the discontinuities $\neq y$ contained in a neighbourhood of $y$ tends to $0$ when the neighbourhood shrinks to a point.

2854,What happens when we call pg_dump while users are still using the system?,"We have a web application with PostgreSQL as our database and use celery background tasks for somewhat complex task. At the very beginning of this complex task we take a backup of the database using pg_dump.

I was wondering about the state of this sql dump if the users are still using the system. Could it cause any inconsistencies ?

Also, I would like to know if pg_dump is the best choice for taking backups in this case. Of course as the database grows the backup takes a lot of time which slows the overall process.

Thanks.

  I was wondering about the state of this sql dump if the users are still using the system


pg_dump relies on PostgreSQL's MVCC support to ask PostgreSQL to take a snapshot of the database state at a given point in time.

Changes made by concurrent transactions after the point where pg_dump gets its snapshot do not affect pg_dump, whether they're committed or not.

There are a few things that aren't necessarily consistent, like sequences, which continue to increase while pg_dump is running. But applications have to be prepared for gaps in sequences anyway, so this isn't considered to be a problem.


  Also, I would like to know if pg_dump is the best choice for taking backups in this case


No, you're way better off using WAL archiving and PITR for your purpose. Look into PgBarman and read the docs on continuous archiving.

You should still take logical dumps for disaster recovery, but it need not be an all-the-time thing.

3900,Do delegates defy OOP,"I'm trying to understand OOP so I can write better OOP code and one thing which keeps coming up is this concept of a delegate (using .NET). I could have an object, which is totally self contained (encapsulated); it knows nothing of the outside world... but then I attach a delegate to it. 

In my head, this is still quite well separated as the delegate only knows what to reference, but this by itself means it has to know about something else outside it's world! That a method exists within another class!

Have I got myself it total muddle here, or is this a grey area, or is this actually down to interpretation (and if so, sorry as that will be off topic I'm sure). My question is, do delegates defy/muddy the OOP pattern?
",Dave,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/72130,"If OOP means each object is responsible for its own interface, then logically delegates could break OOP if it were not used properly.   For example, if I made a FileStream class which, when asked to write, called a delegate to perform the write on behalf of the FileStream class, then it would breach OOP.  This is because the responsibility of the write operation of the FileStream is purely upon FileStream if we're following OOP to the letter.

However, this doesn't mean that using delegates always goes against OOP.  Using the same example, if I used a delegate to handle events before and after writes, this is still following OOP because it is not the responsibility of FileStream to know what should happen before and after writes.  It should merely notify the classes which are responsible.  

If passing delegates to an object were breaching OOP because it knows something outside its world, then also passing variables would breach OOP since you could think of delegates as passing code rather than data to classes.  Acknowledging that there exists code outside of a single OOP class is not breaching anything.

Share defaults values for a model. Defaults are used to populate forms (client-side), while they are enforced server-side
Share validation rules in order to be DRY and perform client/server validation
Share instance methods

It is also called an emitter follower because the emitter voltage always ""follows"" the voltage of the base minus the base-emitter diode voltage drop (about 0.6v).

This mode is not convenient when you try to switch a load that uses a voltage higher than the voltage you connect to the base, so if you try to drive a 12v relay connected to the emitter with a microcontroller that feeds the base of the transistor with 3.3v or 5v then you will see that the relay actually gets 2.7v or 4.4v (for 3.3v and 5v input) which is much lower than needed.

On the other hand it can be very useful if you want to make a regulator, you can use a zener to drive the base with a constant voltage and the emitter output will keep a constant voltage approximately 0.6v lower than the base.

1339,Is Microsoft's fopen commit mode flag broken on Windows 7?,"I write the engine for our company's products, which are designed to run on our clients kiosks.  This includes code to commit file writes to disk.

We have no control over the client's choice of hardware or OS, and for the first time we've been given Windows 7 Embedded to work with.  Suddenly, our secure writes have started failing if power is lost immediately after the flush.

Although including commode.obj causes fflush to commit, even on Win7, I've always preferred to use the MS-specific commit mode flag (""c"") on Windows (the Linux version uses a completely different method), because as I write the library not the products, I can never be sure that commode.obj has actually been included, so I can't throw an error.

FILE* p_f = fopen(""foo.dat"", ""wbc"");
fwrite(p_important_stuff, 1, size, p_f);

4706,Probability density function with conditional distribution and correlation,"I am unsure with question c/d/e/f but I will give my answers for all questions I have attempted.

The random variables $X$ and $Y$ have joint probability density function

$f_{X,Y}(x,y) = ke^{-(x+y)},\ x&gt;0,\ y&gt;0,\ 0&lt;x&lt;y.$

(a) Sketch the region over which the joint probability density function is non-zero.

(b) Show that $k = 2.$

(c) Find the marginal Distribution of $X$; name the distribution and state its mean and variance.

(d) Find the conditional distribution of $Y|X = x$ for $x&gt;0$. Pay particular attention to the range of $Y$ conditional on $x$.

(e) Calculate $Pr(X + Y&lt;1)$.

(f) Given that $E(Y) = 1.5$ and $Var(Y) = 1.25$, calculate the correlation between $X$ and $Y$.

ANSWERS:

(a) Don't know how to draw on here but it's the area above $y=x$ and $y&gt;0$.

(b) Here I used double integration

$\int_0^\infty \int_0^y ke^{-(x+y)}dxdy = 1$

$\int_0^\infty [-ke^{-(x+y)}]_0^y dy = \int_0^\infty[-ke^{-y}+ke^{-2y}]dy$

$[ke^{-y}-\frac{k}{2}e^{-2y}]_0^\infty = [ke^{-0} - \frac{k}{2}e^{-2\cdot0}]-[ke^{-\infty}-\frac{k}{2}e^{-2\cdot \infty}] = [k - \frac{k}{2}]-[0] = \frac{k}2$

Hence $\frac{k}{2}=1$ and $k=2$

(c) $P_x(x)=\int_yP_{X,Y}(x,y)dy=\int_0^\infty2e^{-(x+y)}dy$

$[-2e^{-(x+y)}]_0^\infty= -2e^{-x}$

Presuming that the integration I have done is correct the marginal distribution of $X$ is $-2e^{-x}$ and hence this is a gamma distribution as the limits are $(0,\infty)$ and it just doesn't match the binomial distribution either.

Gamma distribution: $\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\cdot \beta^\alpha}\cdot x^{\alpha-1}\cdot e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}}$

Hence $\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\cdot \beta^\alpha}\cdot x^{\alpha-1}\cdot e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}} = -2e^{-x}$

This is where I have gone wrong as using $\beta = 1$ to leave $e^{-x}$ as that i then need to find:

$\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\cdot 1^\alpha}\cdot x^{\alpha-1} = -2$ and using $\alpha =1$ to make $x^0$ and getting rid of $x$ but this makes $1=-2$.

(d) unsure how to do this question also.

(e) Adding the line $y=1-x$ to the graph from *(a)*we get a new region to find

$\int_0^1 \int_x^{1-x}2e^{-(x+y)}dydx$

$\int_0^1[-2e^{-(x+y)}]_x^{1-x}dx$

$\int_0^1[(-2e^{-2x})-(-2e^{-1})]dx$

$[e^{-2x}+2xe^{-1}]_0^1$

$e^0 + 0 - e^{-2} + 2e^{-1} = 1-\frac{1}{e^2}+\frac{2}{e}$

Hence $Pr(x+y&lt;1) = 1-\frac{1}{e^2}+\frac{2}{e}$

(f) Unsure how to do.
",Matt,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/45783,"On (c), we want to ""integrate out"" $y$. So the density function of $X$ is
$$\int_{y=x}^\infty 2e^{-x}e^{-y}\,dy.$$
Integration yields $2e^{-x}e^{-x}$. So $X$ has exponential distribution, parameter $2$.  

On (d), recall that the conditional density of $Y$ given that $X=x$ is
$$\frac{f_{X,Y}(x,y)}{f_X(x)}.$$
Note that the conditional density is $0$ for $y\lt x$.

On (e), the setup is good. There is a small sign error in the calculation. The number obtained is impossible, it is greater than $1$.

On (f), we will first need the covariance, that is, $E(XY)-E(X)E(Y)$. For that, we need to find 
$$\iint_D (xy) 2e^{-(x+y)}\,dydx,$$
where $D$ is the region where our joint density is positive.

533,Is OTP useful in modern electronic communication?,"I have seen from time to time questions about various OTP schemes and ""OTP"" (i.e. stream cipher) schemes. The most common OTP troubles appear to be:


How to extend size of previously generated key or how to generate key.
How to get key material securely to the recipient.


In electronic communication or storage encryption OTP appears scheme that is impossible to make work and if it works benefits are not clear. Requirement that the key needs to be the same size than input seems to be unbearable for many of modern use cases for encryption.

Is there any practice where OTP is useful in modern cryptography except:


As a component used on some proofs.
As a example ideal of encryption algorithm.


I.e.: Is it possible to base on OTP and provide the ""information theoretic"" strength to hashing (apparently not), authentication, etc.
",user4982,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/4982,"The OTP is more a theoretical construction than a real world construction. The OTP suffers from three core problems:


Key Generation.
Key Distribution.
Key Destruction.


Let's deal with each one in turn.

Key Generation 

Key generation is surprisingly difficult. In order to get the full security proof for the OTP, you need to each bit to be independent of every other bit and for there to be no bias whatsoever in the output.

Now practically every hardware RNG you're going to get does not fufil this in practice. They almost always run the bits through a hash function or some sort of entropy extraction routine. However, these routines do not carry a security proof that they preserve the underlying independent non-bias nature of the bits passed to them. 

It's quite possible that if you the entropy extraction routine over enough bits, that a very small bias would be observed. However, any such bias, no matter how small would destroy the OTP security proof. 

So you need to design your own RNG using only de-biasing techniques that maintain the security proof. Worse, you need to build an RNG with no detectable bias whatsoever over gigabits of output. 

Key Distribution 

Key distribution is a pain because the key has to be as long as the message. This immediately raises the question of why bother with encryption if you already have a secure channel of transmitting the key. Even with this massive key you haven't authenticated the cipher-text! You need provisions for that too.

This limits the OTP to scenarios where you want to time-shift a secure channel. It works okay in scenarios like the following. If Alice lives in Hong Kong and Bob lives in New York, they can meet twice a year and exchange a gigabyte or two of pad and be on their way.

Even if you're using QKD you've just moved the problem elsewhere. The problem now moves from a key distribution problem to an engineering problem. You've got to make a QKD device that is 100% reliable, doesn't have any side channel attacks, and is not susceptible to induced errors. Such as slightly overpowering/underpowering device to get duplicate photons, shinning a laser at the device to subtly break it or some other error inducing attack. 

You've got many of the same problems of hardware quality as you had with the PRG. Good luck with that!

Key Destruction

Once you've used the key you have to make sure it is properly destroyed in both places. This is again more tricky than it seems at first. 

If you don't do this properly and you use the key-stream twice, you have no security at all. If the program that manages the pad for you suffers some sort of error and fails to delete the used portion of the pad then re-use becomes quite likely.  

Worse, because the pad is the same length as the message there's quite a lot of key stream to leak. This can leak in a number of ways. Parts of the key stream might have been paged to disk, for example, during encryption/decryption process. 

An attacker could then decipher parts of your ciphertext by simply XORing bytes from your recovered hard-drive against the ciphertext. 

Conclusion

The reason that the OTP isn't really fielded is that despite its strong security proof, the practical considerations around it actually render it insecure. 

This is actually quite common in cryptography. Things with strong security proofs tend to be unworkable.   

For every section of my reply, there is a documented case where precisely the problem I've raised has led to OTP messages being compromised. 

OTPs are really hard to use properly and are typically less secure overall than a conventional scheme. 

Small secrets, by virtue of them being small, are less likely to be leaked, easier to generate, easier to destroy and easier to transmit. All of these properties make them more secure.

Does anybody know what is wrong here? 
",Thijser,https://robotics.stackexchange.com/users/7226,"I experimented a bit and here's what I think happens.

When you run

$ rostopic echo /questions


The /questions topic doesn't exist before you run the program. Maybe you cheat it by first running your programming, running this command and then running your program again, but this assertion is still true. So at the point when you run your program, rostopic is not subscribed to any topic.

I don't know internally how this is handled by roscore and rostopic, but somewhere along the line, this is what's happening as the observed behavior of rostopic:

forever

    /* establish connection */
    while not subscribed to topic
        try to subscribe
        if failed
            sleep a bit

    /* intercept messages */
    while topic still exists
        wait for message
        print message


This means that rostopic (or more likely roscore on its behalf) waits for a topic to become available and subscribes to it.  It then proceeds to print incoming messages.  If the topic becomes unavailable, rostopic (or again more likely roscore on its behalf) goes back to waiting for the topic to become available again.

That said, here's what happens when this runs in parallel with your code:

    rostopic                       you

  wait for topic
      sleep







  wait for topic
      sleep

                                  start
                                ros::init
                             advertise topic
                          publish first message


subscribe to topic
 wait for message
      sleep


As you can see, your program publishes its first message immediately after advertising the topic. The unsuspecting rostopic program is not yet aware of this advertisement so is not actually subscribed to the topic yet. You publish the first message before rostopic gets a chance to subscribe to the topic.

You can verify this simply by putting a relatively large sleep after you advertise the topics and before you publish to them, i.e. between nc.init() and nc.spin().



To address your real problem (as stated and responded in the comments), which is to understand when the node has started up and use this as a trigger for further actions, I'd advise to consider another strategy.

Generally, you would want to make sure a node is up to make sure the other nodes that depend on it can run correctly. However, this doesn't mean that the original node has to be run just before the depending nodes. It could in theory be run long before them, or since ROS doesn't run in real-time and as you have observed, the timing between when topics are advertised, subscribed and the messages going around are quite unpredictable. Add network to this and they are really unpredictable.

So instead, you could devise a mechanism to query whether your node is available or not. This is simply done with a ROS service. You would essentially do all the necessary startup and then put up a service that always returns true. Any node that needs to ensure this node is available before proceeding can poll this service and as soon as a call to this service succeeds, you know the node is running.

",Doug T.,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/321,"Same reason there different shapes and sizes of screws. It's because there is no single design of screw or screw head which satisfies all requirements. Even when the Phillips design came out there was almost immediate competition from posi-drive and others (most of which have since disappeared) because the Phillips design leaves a lot to be desired, such as the bit rising in the slots when the screw gets tight. Some designs, such as allen heads, have been around a lot longer and for most purposes are very superior but even then, a countersunk allen head of necessity has a rather small socket which creates other problems, such as a tendency to break the keys. Also, allen heads and other socket designs are mostly only used in hardened materials, which resist the tendency of the socket to deform under pressure.

The reason we currently have so (relatively) few mainstream designs of screws is simple practicality. Nobody, merchant or user, wants to stock the massive number of screws we would need to have to use the best possible design for every possible application, so we compromise and use ones that are adequate in the majority of cases.

Should one really not violate this at all?

Should the standard be the same horizontally and vertically?
",Tintels,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/4703,"
The best learning resource for this would be a good introduction on typography – probably the seminal classic by Bringhurst (see http://webtypography.net for a good roundup applied to the web), though e. g. Spiekermann's ‘Stop Stealing Sheep…’ is not bad for starters, either – and on design grids (see my answer here on UXexchange).
When designing grids you are mostly using a basic module (proportions ideally defined by working from the content outwards) that all content is fitted to (i.e. multiples of it).
Vertical and horizontal margins between blocks are in most cases different. Vertical whitespace is often oriented on the baseline grid (see e.g. Bringhurst, again). Using one is highly recommended to achieve at a unifying vertical rhythm.
The minimum amount of horizontal whitespace, i. e. primarily the separation between columns of body text (gutter), is governed by Gestalt psychology with font size, line spacing, and line width as main influencing factors. You should place text blocks far enough from another such that your recipients will be able to see them as distinct units of their own. A traditional rule of thumb would make the gutter at least 1.5 ems wide in order to appear significantly wider than any possible whitespace within a line of text. On the screen, good line spacing tends to be a little bit wider than in traditional print, though. Hence you will probably need a little bit more than that. Using the same value as your baseline grid is a good guess to start with in most cases.
BTW: design standards – unless significantly backed up by ergonomics or cognitive psychology – are never standards in the more rigid sense of the word. You may violate any ‘standard’ as long as you know why you are doing it.

v[n]=x0,0,x1,0,x2,0,x3,0

$x[n] \rightarrow$ zeropad $\rightarrow v[n]$

$v[n]\rightarrow$ LPF $\rightarrow y[m]$

My $y[m]$ is the output of LPF which removes aliases. So basically LPF transfer function is given as 

$$
y[m] = v[n]*h[n]
$$

i,e. $y[m]=\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}h(m-n)v(n)$

So here $h[m]$ is my filter coefficients and  $v[n]$ is my zero padded input signal...
so, if I multiply zero with my filter coefficients, then my output will also be zero...

If I send 10 input samples, after zero padding I will get 20 samples, out of which 10 will be zero....

So what is the use of getting zero as my output? Correct me if am wrong (I know I am wrong, but please give me some idea how zero padding &amp; LPF is helping in this regard).

For FIR filter: $y(n)=h(0)x(n)+h(1)x(n−1)+....+h(N−1)x(n−N+1)$,
 where $x(n)$ is the input signal,
 $y(n)$ is the output signal, 
$h(n)$ is the impulse response, 
and $N$ is the filter length.

               v[n]--&gt;[2  0  4  0  6  0  8  0 ] (after zero padding)


Lets calculate for $y[2.5]=h(0)x(2.5)+h(1)x(1.5)+h(2)x(0.5)+h(3)x(-0.5)$ 

so here $x(2.5)=x(1.5)=x(0.5)=0$

6697,Is it a problem with radiometric dating that carbon 14 is found in materials dated to millions of years old?,"The preferred method of dating dinosaur fossils is with the radiometric dating method. And the result of this accepted method dates dinosaur fossils to around 68 million years old.

However:
Consider the C-14 decay rate. Its half-life ($t_{1/2}$) is only 5,730 years—that is, every 5,730 years, half of it decays away. The theoretical limit for C-14 dating is 100,000 years using AMS, but for practical purposes it is 45,000 to 55,000 years. If dinosaur bones are 65 million years old, there should not be one atom of C-14 left in them.

Dinosaurs are not dated with Carbon-14, yet some researchers have claimed that there is still Carbon-14 in the bones.

So what needs to be done about this inconsistency? Do these data indicate that a more accurate method needs to be derived? What solutions are available for increasing accuracy of the tests? Or do we need another dating method all together?

Considering Contamination

From the source linked above:


  Carbon-14 is considered to be a highly reliable dating technique.  It's accuracy has been verified by using C-14 to date artifacts whose age is known historically. The fluctuation of the amount of C-14 in the atmosphere over time adds a small uncertainty, but contamination by ""modern carbon"" such as decayed organic matter from soils poses a greater possibility for error.
  
  Dr. Thomas Seiler, a physicist from Germany, gave the presentation in Singapore.  He said that his team and the laboratories they employed took special care to avoid contamination. That included protecting the samples, avoiding cracked areas in the bones, and meticulous pre-cleaning of the samples with chemicals to remove possible contaminants.  Knowing that small concentrations of collagen can attract contamination, they compared precision Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) tests of collagen and bioapatite (hard carbonate bone mineral) with conventional counting methods of large bone fragments from the same dinosaurs. ""Comparing such different molecules as minerals and organics from the same bone region, we obtained concordant C-14 results which were well below the upper limits of C-14 dating. These, together with many other remarkable concordances between samples from different fossils, geographic regions and stratigraphic positions make random contamination as origin of the C-14 unlikely"".

",Decrypted,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/52046,"There is a lot of discussion about this issue on this internet, so I think this question may be worth addressing seriously. The main point of the debate seems to be the following:

Over the past decades, several research groups of self-proclaimed creationist scientists have claimed discoveries of dinosaur bones that they have managed to date, using radiocarbon dating methods, at some age which is a lot below the 'usual' i.e. mainstream accepted date for the age of these bones (several dozens of million years old). The age that these groups claim to find is usually on the order of thousands or tens of thousands of years old.

The research by Miller et al.

The claims by these creationist research groups are quite spectacular; they deserve to be seriously looked into. Let us investigate the specific case referenced in the question: 
A research team from the CRSEF, or Creation Research, Science Education Foundation, led by Hugh Miller, has claimed to have dated dinosaur bones using radiocarbon methods, determining them to be no older than several dozens of thousands of years old. Let's look at their research methodology in detail (indicated by bullet points):


As it turns out, Miller's research group obtained their sample in quite a remarkable way. In fact, the creationist posed as chemists in order to secure a number of fragments of fossilized dinosaur bone from a museum of natural history, misrepresenting their own research in the process of doing so. 
When the museum provided the bone fragments, they emphasized that they had been heavily contaminated with ""shellac"" and other chemical preservatives. Miller and his group accepted the samples and reassured the museum that such containments would not be problematic for the analysis at hand. They then sent it to a laboratory run by the University of Arizona, where radiocarbon dating could be carried out. To get the scientists to consider their sample, the researchers once again pretended to be interested in the dating for general chemical analysis purposes, misrepresenting their research.


Let's quickly stop to consider the general issue of misrepresenting your own research. It is understandable that Miller et al. did this, since there would have been a slim chance (at best) of the museum curator providing them with any dinosaur bone fragments if he or she had known what the true intent of the supposed chemists was. In particular, it is implausible that it would have been considered worthwhile to try to use radiocarbon dating methods on these bones, since the rocks that they were taken from were determined to be 99+ million years old, as shown in this paper by Kowallis et al. Now, it is known that $^{14}\text{C}$ decays at a fast enough rate (half-life ~6000 years) for this dating method to be absolutely useless on such samples. Thus, it appears that Miller et al. would not have been able to obtain this sample, had they been honest about their intent. This, of course, raises some ethical questions, but let's brush these aside for now. We proceed with the examination of the research done by Miller and his fellow researchers from the CRSEF.

What exactly are we dating here? Sample contamination and general trustworthyness


After the samples were submitted by the laboratory, Miller et al. were informed by a professor from the University of Arizona that the samples were heavily contaminated, and that no collagen (where most of the carbon for $^{14}\text{C}$ dating comes from) was present. Miller let assured the professor that the analysis was still of interest to the group. The issue of contaminations is quite a serious one, as can be seen in this paper by Hedges and Gowlett (sorry, paywalled!!!). I quote (quote also reproduced in the paper by Lepper that I linked earlier: 



  At a horizon of 40,000 years the amount of carbon 14 in a
  bone or a piece of charcoal can be truly minute: such a
  specimen may contain only a few thousand 14C atoms. Consequently equally small quantities of modern carbon can
  severely skew the measurements. Contamination of this kind
  amounting to 1 percent of the carbon in a sample 25,000
  years old would make it appear to be about 1,500 years
  younger than its actual age. Such contamination would,
  however, reduce the apparent age of a 60,000-year-old object
  by almost 50 percent. Clearly proper sample decontamination
  procedures are of particular importance in
  the dating of very old artifacts 


It is clear that the sample provided by Miller did not under go any 'sample decontamination procedures' at all, and it is therefore strongly questionable to which extent it can be used to obtain a good estimate of the age of the bones. Furthermore, it appears less than certain that the carbon found in the bones actually had anything to do with them being dinosaur bones. In the article by Leppert, we find:


  Hugh Miller generously provided me with a copy of the
  elemental analysis of one of their dinosaur fossils. Daniel Fisher of the University
  of Michigan’s Museum of Paleontology examined these results and concludes that
  there is nothing whatsoever extraordinary about them. The predominant suite of
  elements present and their relative percentages (including the 3.4% carbon!) are
  about what one would expect to find in hydroxyapatite and calcite, two of the
  commonest minerals present in ordinary dinosaur fossils. There is absolutely
  nothing unusual about these fossils and no reason to think the carbon contained
  in them is organic carbon derived from the original dinosaur bone. 
  
  Robert Kalin senior research specialist at the University of Arizona’s
  radiocarbon dating laboratory, performed a standard independent analysis of the
  specimens submitted by Hugh Miller and concluded that the samples identified
  as “bones” did not contain any collagen. They were, in fact, not bone.


These results corroborated established paleontological theories that assert that these fossiles presumably were 'washed away' over long periods of time by ground water, replacing the original bones with other substances such as the minerals naturally present in the water, implying that this sample could not tell you anything about when a dinosaur lived (or rather, died). 

Conclusions

At this point, it is quite clear that there is little reason to trust the research by Miller's research group. In fact, the article by Leppert raises a number of additional issues (e.g. Miller's group refuses to reveal where some other samples of theirs were dated), but I think it is pointless to argue further: It is obvious that the CRSEF research group did a poor job in sticking to the scientific method, and that little objective value can be assigned to their supposed findings.

Right now we're starting out with basic Java and such (so right from the bottom you might say) - which is fine, I have no programming experience apart from knowing how to do ""Hello World"" in Java.

I keep hearing that mathematics is pertinent to coding, but how is it so? What general examples would show how mathematics and programming go together, or are reliant on one another?

I apologize of my question is vague, I'm barely starting to get a rough idea of the kind of world I'm stepping into as a code monkey student...
",Rory,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/48536,"A problem with your question is that ""mathematics"" and ""programming"" are both very wide and deep subjects about which there is more to know than anyone could master in a lifetime (no exaggeration).  I personally hold an MA degree in mathematics.  During my time in university, it seemed as if the more I learned, the less I knew compared to my peers; it felt is if I became less intelligent over the years.  When I presented my master's thesis to a group of professors, even most of them seemed to be largely unfamiliar with what I studied.

Likewise, I am now a database-driven web application developer.  If you compared me to someone who does embedded assembler language programming, you might think of us as two very talented professionals, but we would have vastly different expertise even though we're both ""programmers"".

As you progress in your study of higher mathematics (beyond freshman calculus), you will find that mathematics instills a discipline for abstract reasoning that will serve you well when you program.  I think that this discipline is very important because you will deal with abstract concerns as you program.

Sure, in freshman programming, you will likely learn about pointer arithmetic.  You will write short programs to illustrate this concept and your understanding of how it drives your computer obey your will.  However, learning about how pointer arithmetic works in the abstract will not make you good at using pointers in a real program.  When it comes time to take on a mess of 10K lines of code and make some changes to the pointer arithmetic, you will need to be able to reason at a very abstract level, making strategic decisions to balance different concerns about how your changes will affect the code.

As a programmer, you must balance ""readability"" of your code, performance of your code, ease-of-use of the resulting programs, among many other concerns.  You must be able to make very abstract comparisons to balance these concerns among one another.  You will make many of these comparisons every day.  I haven't even gotten started about time-management.  You will abstractly reason about the probability that something you do will affect your ability to do your tasks on time, and once again, you will make many decisions every day that will affect your work.

Finally, you must maintain your philosophical discipline to be able to assimilate new ideas and concepts in order to be able to continue on as old methodologies and practices fall out of use.  Once again, you will have to be able to evaluate the ideas that come along and make an abstract comparison to what you already know.

In short, programming, as most of us know it, doesn't have a whole lot to do with mathematics, as most of us know it; but when you look at it at an abstract level, they have a lot in common.

I shot with a D90 with a 18-200 lens, no filters or hoods attached. The settings were quite strained (iso 3200, often at max length and max aperture for the length. This specific picture is 1/125, f 5.3, 95 mm). 
",rumtscho,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/2099,"All cameras contain lenses which are actually comprised of several ""lens elements."" Lens flare is caused by non-image light which does not pass (refract) directly along its intended path, but instead reflects internally on lens elements any number of times (back and forth) before finally reaching the film or digital sensor



A good lens hood can nearly eliminate flare caused by stray light from outside the angle of view. Ensure that this hood has a completely non-reflective inner surface, such as felt, and that there are no regions which have rubbed off. Although using a lens hood may appear to be a simple solution, in reality most lens hoods do not extend far enough to block all stray light. This is particularly problematic when using 35 mm lenses on a digital SLR camera with a ""crop factor,"" because these lens hoods were made for the greater angle of view. In addition, hoods for zoom lenses can only be designed to block all stray light at the widest focal length.

Petal lens hoods often protect better than non-petal (round) types. This is because petal-style hoods take into account the aspect ratio of the camera's film or digital sensor, and so the angle of view is greater in one direction than the other.Placing a hand or piece of paper exterior to the side of the lens which is nearest the flare-inducing light source can also mimic the effect of a proper lens hood. 

Lens flare also depends on the lens used - fixed focal length (or prime) lenses are less susceptible to lens flare than zoom lenses. Other than having an inadequate lens hood at all focal lengths, more complicated zoom lenses often have to contain more lens elements. Zoom lenses therefore have more internal surfaces from which light can reflect.

You can of course set Scalatra up without using conscript, by manually copying values around, but it wouldn't be very convenient. g8 definitely depends on conscript, I don't think you can have one without the other. The Scalatra crew will need to take a look at conscript and see what's going on here. You may actually want to file a bug on installation so that it gets looked at.

If your application does need to make changes to HKLM then consider doing so at installation time because the installer will be run elevated.

If a desktop application does need to write to HKLM then it should consider separating those parts of the application that need to run elevated into a separate process. Otherwise the users are going to be very fed up with having to go through a UAC dialog in order to run your application. Even if they aren't using the part of the application that writes to HKLM.

8467,"Which words may start with ""al-""?","Is there a rule which determines whether it allowable for a word to be ""merged"" with ""all"" to make a new word starting ""al-""

e.g.


  1)All together -> Altogether
  
  2)All right -> Alright


The first is generally accepted. Whereas I believe the second is technically not (certainly my English teacher used to condemn it).
",Urbycoz,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/7451,"I'll quote what my NOAD says:


  USAGE - The merging of all and right to form the one-word spelling alright is first recorded toward the end of the 19th century (unlike other similar merged spellings such as altogether and already, which date from much earlier). There is no logical reason for insisting that all right be two words when other single-word forms such as altogether have long been accepted. Nevertheless, although found widely, alright remains nonstandard.


So, although alright is ""older"", altogether is considered to be standard.

Plus, as the OALD states, altogether and all together are not synonyms:


  Altogether and all together do not mean the same thing. 
  
  
  Altogether means ‘in total’ or (in British English) ‘completely’: We have invited fifty people altogether. ◇ I am not altogether convinced by this argument.
  All together means ‘all in one place’ or ‘all at once’: Can you put your books all together in this box? ◇ Let’s sing ‘Happy Birthday’. All together now!
  


And, as @Matt Ellen reminded me (us), not even all right and alright are synonyms, see his comment.

Other terms are already, as mentioned above, and about the al- prefix, the Oxford English Dictionary, says:


  obs. form of all, retained in comp. in albeit, almighty, almost, alone, already, although, always.

Should I abstract away the RestClient, and put the Interface dependency at the class level and injected from withint he constructor?? If i go with this route, does that mean I have to interface out all the dependencies ??

",Eatdoku,https://stackoverflow.com/users/83181,"If you don't want a class level RestClient field in SomeRepository, you can use method injection, and add a RestClient parameter to the CheckSomething method. You can then mock the RestClient for your unit tests.

If that were my code, I would want to test the following things:


Has the RestRequest that was passed into the RestClient.Execute method been properly setup.
Does the method return true or false based on the response.StatusCode
Does any other status code result in an exception being thrown.


If that is all you need to test, then the only thing you need to mock is the RestClient, which means you could easily just use method injection, or constructor or property injection.

5228,How much did the 'The Evil Queen' rule in OUAT?,"In Once Upon a Time when Regina became queen, how much did she rule over? Was it only the entirety of the Enchanted Forest?

How long/far did her power extend to? Did she own every single part of land in the Kingdom?
",Izumi-reiLuLu,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/20797,"Much like the fairy tales they are based on, the show has been very vague about exactly what Regina was ""queen"" over when she was the Evil Queen. However, I think it was less than your questions imply, because we've seen more than one king/queen ruling within the bounds of the Enchanted Forest:


Regina married Snow White's father, King Leopold.
David (Charming) is the adoptive son of King George.
David also has to do a favor for King Midas
Maleficent was nomimally the Queen of her own kingdom.
Princess Aurora was presumably the daughter of yet another King/Queen.


So, legally, I suspect Regina was ""only"" the Queen of one of several kingdoms in the Enchanted Forest, though the boundaries of that kingdom are never spelled out.

However, Regina was also one of the most powerful rulers in the Enchanted Forest, in particular because of the powerful magic that she possessed. Thus, I assume that once she became The Evil Queen, she would have started to enforce her will beyond it's normal borders. We can sort-of imply this by the fact that no one ever mentions going to other Kings for help with Regina, e.g. Charming never even considers asking his father for help with Regina. In fact, other than flashbacks, we don't see much of anything out of the other rules of the Enchanted Forest (except possibly Maleficent, who appeared to still be ruling over her kingdom when Charming encounters her.)

As far as how much of the land in her kingdom did she own, that's a bit of a tricky question that relates to medieval politics and ownership laws. Generally speaking, if her kingdom were modeled after a typical feudal society (as evidenced by the existence of titular knights), all of the land would have initially been owned by the king/queen, but would have been given to various lords as rewards for their fealty. Those lords would typically own the land and lease it to peasants and other working-class citizens in exchange for taxes or tithes. Exactly how much ownership transferred and what rights the king/queen still had over the land would depends on the specific laws of the country.

But again, in practice, if the king decided he wanted to reclaim ownership of some plot of land in his kingdom, no one would really stop him. Given Regina's strength, that goes even moreso for her.

2472,Can a number have both a periodic an a non-periodic representation in a non-integer base?,"Fix an algebraic number $\beta$ and consider a complex number $\alpha$ which admits multiple representations in base $\beta$. If one representation of $\alpha$ is ultimately periodic, must every other representation of $\alpha$ be ultimately periodic?

Bonus question: Does this depend on the choice of the set of digits?

Edit: John Bentin showed that this is false in general, even with $\beta \in \Bbb{Q}$. Is this true at least for $\beta$ algebraic integer?

Edit 2: This question came up when trying to solve this problem of mine.



All I know so far is that if $\beta$ is a Pisot integer, i.e. if it is a real algebraic integer greater than $1$ with every conjugate lying in the unit circle, then $\alpha \in \Bbb{Q}(\beta)$ if and only if it has an ultimately periodic expansion (which is stronger than my question).
",A.P.,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/65389,"The following counterexample answers the supplementary question added in the edit. Choose the algebraic integer $\sqrt2$ as the base. Then we may expand $1$ in the periodic form $$1=\frac12+\frac14+\cdots+\left(\frac{0}{(\sqrt2)^{2k-1}}+\frac{1}{(\sqrt2)^{2k}}\right)+\cdots.$$But we can also express it in a more irregular expansion:$$1=\frac1{\sqrt2}+\frac14+\frac1{32}+\frac1{64\sqrt2}+\cdots+\frac{a_k}{\sqrt2^k}+\cdots,$$where $a_k=1$ if $$1-\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}\frac{a_j}{\sqrt2^j}&gt;\frac1{\sqrt2^k},$$ with $a_k=0$ otherwise, for $k=1,2,\dots\,$. To show that the irregular expansion is aperiodic, assume the contrary: namely that there exist integers $l\geqslant0$ and $m\geqslant1$ satisfying $$1=\sum_{k=1}^l\frac{a_k}{\sqrt2^k}+\frac1{\sqrt2^{l+1}}\sum_{k=1}^m\frac{a_{l+k}}{\sqrt2^k}\frac1{1-1/\sqrt2^{m}}.$$We may ensure that $l$ is positive by including, if necessary, the first cycle of $m$ terms of the periodic tail in the initial (pre-periodic) length-$l$ segment of the expansion. Since the terminal factor $1/(1-1/\sqrt2^{m})$ is either a positive rational number or the sum of a positive rational number and a positive rational multiple of $\sqrt2,$ the whole of the RHS of the above sum is of this form. Moreover it is not rational---because the initial segment (of length $l$) includes the first term $1/\sqrt2,$ and so the overall coefficient of $\sqrt2$ is at least $\frac12$. But the LHS is rational: a contradiction.

I thought that valCouche would have the argument of valLissage but instead it gives False as a value.

",guy16,https://stackoverflow.com/users/4862605,"You've got multiple problems here.

First, if you write this in the middle of a class definition:

valCouche = nameCouche()


... you're creating a class attribute, which is shared by all instances, not a normal instance attribute.

Also, you're running this at class definition time. That means there is no self yet--there aren't any instances yet to be self--so you can't call a method like nameCouche, because you don't have anything to call it on.

What you want to do is call the method at instance initialization time, on the instance being initialized, and store the return value in an instance attribute:

def __init__(self):
    self.valCouche = self.nameCouche()


Then, when you want to access this value in another method later, you have to access it as self.valCouche.



If you make those changes, it will work. But your object model still doesn't make much sense. Why is nameCouche a method when it doesn't have anything to do with the object, and doesn't access any of its attributes? Maybe it makes sense as a @staticmethod, but really, I think it makes more sense just as a plain function outside the class. In fact, none of the code you've written seems to have anything to do with the class. 

This kind of cram-everything-into-the-class design is often a sign that you're trying to write Java code in Python, and haven't yet really understood how Python does OO. You might want to read a good tutorial on Python classes. But briefly: if you're writing a class just to have somewhere to dump a bunch of vaguely-related functions, what you want is a module, not a class. If you have some reason to have instances of that class, and the functions all act on the data of each instance, then you want a class.

I've been using who.is all this time but the details for domains I look up aren't always recent. What whois database is the most accurate and up-to-date? I've tried looking up a few but it's hard to tell how often each one updates its database. 
",Miss M,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/52761,"Being one who has a similar site, I would have thought who.is or whois.com were the most accurate. Mine is different in that I capture the information at the time of an attack, spam, or other similar event. However, most other sites will re-query the whois data when the page is accessed assuming that there is a measure to ensure that the same whois data is not being requested to often. Some sites subscribe and download bulk whois data from time to time and update their databases that way instead of relying on traffic. With a large site such as these, it is nearly impossible to keep the data 100% fresh. There are limits to whois look-ups and sites have to be careful not to over do it.

The best thing to do is either use nslookup in a Windows command window or nslookup or whois in a terminal window in Linux. This will give you the current whois information. But be sure not to try and make bulk queries or you just may be blacklisted. Spread them out a bit and you should be fine.

1122,Compiling in Code::Blocks with Dependencies,"I have a project in Code::Blocks which uses uses a dynamic library, and will use more in the future.  I have set up the project correctly to use the library, and it compiles and runs perfectly fine.

However, I'm wondering if there is a way to compile a release version of the exe with the dlls needed in a folder alongside it.  (I'd prefer not to hunt them each down and copy/paste them in.)
I feel like I'm missing something, or going about it the wrong way.

Is there anyway to have Code::Blocks do this or a better way of obtaining an easy-to-distribute zipfile/project?

How could I use makefiles (cmake preferably, but any type compatible with Windows would be great) to accomplish this?
",Numeri,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2577654,"CodeBlocks offers the ability to execute pre or post build things. Checkout menu ""Project->Build options"", and under the ""Pre/Post build steps"" tab, you can insert any shell command you want. For example:



When hitting F9, you will see:

-------------- Build: Release in aaa (compiler: GNU GCC Compiler)---------------
Target is up to date.
Running target post-build steps
echo ""Hi""
Hi
Process terminated with status 0 (0 minutes, 0 seconds)
0 errors, 0 warnings (0 minutes, 0 seconds)


So you can add here any command you want to gather you files together, for example something like (using 7-zip):

7z a my_archive.zip myfile1.exe myfile2.dll readme.txt


Be advised that this will be executed at every build which is not something you might want: when compiling a minor change in program, you don't want to wait for the archive program. So maybe do this only in a special build target.

5047,Decoding Matrix Encoded Surround Sound Through Convolution,"I wish to create a finite impulse response filter to decode a dolby digital matrix encoded 2 channel signal into 5 channels. These filters would then be used in a realtime pipeline on a Linux machine using jack and jconvolver to do the convolution.

The equation is as follows:

 

The reference for the above equation is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decoder

It would seem this should be able to be done but I haven't the faintest how. Any help, and in particular working code that could generate the filters (Octave or other open source preferred) would be much appreciated!
",psandersen,https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/3142,"Suppose that we had two channels encoded in some form in two signals according to a matrix.  Recovering the original signals would be straightforward using the matrix inverse (or impossible, if the inverse did not exist).  The situation is no different here, except that the matrix is not square, so you cannot use the conventional matrix inverse.  You can, however, use a pseudoinverse or generalized inverse to reconstruct the original signals.  

Other matrices which are not equal to an inverse may work also succeed, and may in fact sound better.  I don't know the psychoacoustic situation, but it may more sense to do some transform based on the position of speakers for example. Certainly, the inverse seems like a good place to start.

I rewrote your encoder table as a 2x5 input matrix $ E $, and used Wolfram Alpha to determine the inverse, $ D = E^{-1} $.  Here is the 5x2 result it provided, using $ i $ as the imaginary unit, with $ j = i $ and $ k = -i $.

$$
D = \frac{1}{18(46+6\sqrt{2})} \begin{bmatrix}
405 &amp; -3(27 - 36\sqrt{2}) \\
-3(27 - 36\sqrt{2}) &amp; 405 \\
6(18+27\sqrt{2}) &amp; 6(18+27\sqrt{2}) \\
-i(27\sqrt{3} + 99\sqrt{6}) &amp; i(63\sqrt{3} + 27\sqrt{6}) \\
-i(63\sqrt{3} + 27\sqrt{6}) &amp; i(27\sqrt{3} + 99\sqrt{6}) 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

As one would expect, the decoding matrix shows left/right symmetry.

Now we can express the encoding/decoding operations as:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
L_{encoded} \\
R_{encoded}
\end{bmatrix} = E \space{} \begin{bmatrix}
L \\
R \\
C \\
L_{rear} \\
R_{rear} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
L' \\
R' \\
C' \\
L_{rear}' \\
R_{rear}' \\
\end{bmatrix} = D \space{} \begin{bmatrix}
L_{encoded} \\
R_{encoded}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Now you can easily obtain formulas to express the three front components as functions of the encoded left and right signals.  For the two rear components, you have an equation in the time domain with a complex component.

Looking at the left rear component, and converting constants from the matrix $ D $ to numeric form:
$$
L_{rear}'[n] = -i0.2949 L_{encoded}[n] + i0.1787 R_{encoded}[n]
$$

The Hilbert transform can be used to remove the imaginary unit, because this has the same effect on the frequency domain of performing a ±90º phase shift.  The Hilbert transform only needs to be applied once, since convolution ($ * $) is distributive and commutative and all other good things.
$$
L_{rear}'[n] = (-0.2949 L_{encoded}[n] + 0.1787 R_{encoded}[n]) * H[n]
$$

The operating principle, then, is that the encoding technique functions in part by encoding the left/right rear components in quadrature.

The Hilbert transform is infinitely long, so it must be truncated and expressed as either a FIR filter, or depending on your circumstances, a FFT-IFFT operation.  A causal Hilbert transform will delay the rear channels, so your other filters will need to be delayed by some amount to compensate.

For example, if $ k $ is the group delay of a causal approximation of a Hilbert filter $ H_k[n] $ then you delay must delay the three front channels by $ k $ as well:
$$
C'[n] = (0.3437L_{encoded}[n] + 0.3437R_{encoded}[n]) * \delta[n-k]
$$

In practice, all of the output signals depend on the two input signals.  That is, you take two input channels and produce one output channel five times.  Your JACK pipeline will need to accommodate this.

So the problem with this array is that it starts to dublicate the CPT's when I query them, sometimes even it queries 4 random posts from CPT.

One solution would be to create 9 different queries - one for each CPT, but this seems to be overkill for the front page. 

Is there a way to really only query 1  random post per CPT in a way that wouldn't affect the page loading time so much?

3236,Do dice finish resolving before yielding Tokyo?,"When does yielding occur in relation to dice resolution? Simultaneously? After all dice have resolved? After attack dice are resolved?

For example (A for attack die, H for heart):

Alice is outside Tokyo, Bob is inside. It is now Alice's turn.
Alice rolls: 3, 3, 3, A, A, H
? Handle VP and hearts?
Alice attacks Bob
Bob chooses to yield


Now consider the possibility Alice has a single shrink ray token, so she only rolls 5 dice:

Alice is outside Tokyo, Bob is inside. It is now Alice's turn.
Alice rolls: 3, 3, 3, A, H
? Handle VP and hearts?
Alice attacks Bob
Bob chooses to yield


She must choose if the heart is applied to heal for one, or if it will remove the shrink ray token. In this case, order of resolution for the attack/yield and heart matters (more/less information for Alice &amp; Bob, inability to heal in Tokyo). Is there an order to the dice resolution (eg hearts then attacks), or is the yield not declared until after all dice have resolved?
",thegrinner,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/3101,"It is my opinion that the dice indicate what happens to you at your current location. A heart dice would indicate that you healed, if your location permits it. 

This is partially supported by the fact that one must take all damage rolled even if one cedes Tokyo. You should similarly be able to use all hearts even if you are forced to take Tokyo. There's absolutely no mention or implication of any other possibility.

Everyone I've played with has naturally come to the same understanding. You could view podcasts of people playing KoT, but I'm sure they've come to the same conclusion.


  She must choose if the heart is applied to heal for one, or if it will remove the shrink ray token. In this case, order of resolution for the attack/yield and heart matters


No, it doesn't. According to the FAQ on BoardGameGeek, removing a bad counter counts as healing and is thus equally forbidden in Tokyo, so the order does not affect the choice.

Scheduled Jobs (and any code they call) will forever run under the post-install context,
Batch Jobs execute as the post-install user and suffer the same issues above,

",LoneWOLFs,https://superuser.com/users/85063,"I did the update earlier today though and it seems that there is a folder C:\$Windows.~BT that got created and downloaded.  You might TRY to take and copy that folder to another 8 machine and see if running the setup file will work for you.  If it does...awesome...

However if that doesn't work, Unless it changes later, currently you can get to 8.1 via 3 methods:


You can update each machine running 8 via the Windows Store
You can use a VL download or Technet/MSDN download.  You'll have to have an account though, and I'm pretty sure it won't update non VL 8 machines.
You can buy a retail copy on Amazon or similar.


According to the MS Blog on 8.1 they aren't planning an ISO / IT Pro standalone installer:

  We're not releasing the ISO images to folks who don't have MSDN and

3325,Why do you multiply one way and divide the other way with these trig problems?,"I am practicing finding a side of an angle on Khan Academy. I understand SOH CAH TOA and which sin, cos, tan to choose from. But, I don't understand why they multiply sometimes to find the side and divide other times. I am using a calculator.

Here is a multiply example


and a divide example


thanks.
",Tyler Zika,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/45831,"In the 1st problem, I think you understand it as far as the next-to-last line, $$\sin A={BC\over\sqrt{97}}$$ Also, you are given the value $$\sin A={9\sqrt{97}\over97}$$ So you have $${9\sqrt{97}\over97}={BC\over\sqrt{97}}$$ Since you want $BC$, you multiply both sides of this equation by $\sqrt{97}$ --- that gets $BC$ all by itself on one side of the equation, which is what you want. 

In the second problem, you understand $$\tan A={10\over AC}$$ You want to isolate $AC$. This can be done by multiplying both sides by $AC$, getting $$(AC)(\tan A)=10$$ and then dividing both sides by $\tan A$ to get $$AC={10\over\tan A}$$

Now you are given $$\tan A={10\over3}$$ so you have $$AC={10\over10/3}$$ which simplifies to $3$.

2874,How can I speed up the rate at which putty dries?,"We're (slowly) renovating the sash windows in our house and the current window is causing problems. What should have been a quick job (especially at this time of year!) has turned into a marathon because the putty won't dry.

We had to replace a couple of panes of glass (one was cracked and we broke another when using a heat gun to remove the paint) so we knew it would take a little while. On a previous window the putty took over three weeks to dry enough to paint partly because (as we thought) there was too much oil. So this time we rolled the putty on newspaper first to try to remove the excess oil. It seemed to work, but after two weeks the putty is still soft to the touch.

We've tried standing the windows next to a radiator but all that seemed to do was make it softer (which was obviously going to happen in hindsight).

So given that we don't want to reputty the windows what can we do to speed up the drying process.

We've had to seal off the room and cover the window as best we can in the meantime.

I've found this advice on DoItYourself.com which doesn't really help as it says use other materials!

The answers to this post on DIY-Forums are confusing at best and possibly contradictory as one recommends exposing the putty to moisture(!) to speed the drying process.

8576,C# + PHP in the same application?,"What im trying to do is a little different, im wondering, if its possible to create sorts of an interface, so that if a particular function is called in php (stand alone), than the arguments will be forwarded to a method in C#, and vice versa. 
",caesay,https://stackoverflow.com/users/184746,"Depends of course on what kind of data you want to exchange, if the applications are on the same server or on two different ones etc.

I did briding between PHP and C# in some of my web based projects. What I did: create an ASP.NET MVC project which exposes a RESTful API. The methods exposed by this API are then called from PHP via HTTP (using CURL). I used JSON as a data exchange format to pass data from PHP to C# and back again. This worked good as the two applications were on different servers.

I could also imagine some kind of socket server. E. g. a background process written in C# is listening on some port, and then you connect to it via PHP´s socket functions. I did something like this to connect PHP and Java. The Java app ran as a demon process on port XXXX and was a wrapper around Apache FOP. I used PHPs socket functions to pass XML and XSLT to the Java demon which then used Apache FOP to transform the data into a pdf and returned that via the socket connection back to PHP which in turn sent the PDF file to the client requesting the page.

There are probably some other approaches, but these were my experiences so far in connecting two different technologies together.

EDIT: as an aside: PHP on a windows webserver using IIS was really not that nice to work with. Sometimes strange errors occured or certain permission related errors that were not easy to resolve. YMMV though.

Since the Urban Companion alternate class feature explicitly defines an equivalent arcane caster level for the purpose of obtaining a familiar through this ACF, the familiar tables' normal requirement for an arcane spellcaster level is satisfied by this; therefore, by RAW, characters with Urban Companion qualify for Improved Familiar, analogous to how cleric domains unlock feats for clerics, as they also already have the ability to obtain a familiar (via Urban Companion), and the alignment compatibility prerequisite is simply a restriction on which familiars you can have, not on the ability to take a familiar to begin with.

3195,Examples of two different descriptions of a set that are not obviously equivalent?,"I am teaching a course in enumerative combinatorics this semester and one of my students asked for deeper clarification regarding the difference between a ""combinatorial"" and a ""bijective"" proof.  Specifically, they pointed out that when one is proving the validity of a combinatorial identity by counting a set in two different ways, this is a different activity than giving an explicit bijection between two different sets.  However, in combinatorics we often use the phrases ""combinatorial proof"" and ""bijective proof"" as synonyms, and I have often heard people use the phrase ""bijective proof"" regarding a ""count in two different ways"" proof of an identity.

It seems to me that often a combinatorial proof arises from describing one set in two different ways; implicit in a proof of the equality of the two descriptions of this set is the identity bijection from the set to itself.  In this sense, one might regard all ""combinatorial"" proofs as ""bijective,"" but I feel that I am on quite shaky ground with this.  These thoughts have led me to the following questions:

Question 1: What are some examples of combinatorial situations where the same set can be described in two different ways but it is not at all clear that the two descriptions yield the same object?

Question 2: What are some examples of situations where two bijective proofs have been given for a theorem or identity where the bijections turned out to be the same, but proving their equivalence was non-trivial?

I would also appreciate opinions regarding the distinction, if any, between combinatorial arguments where one proves identities by describing a set in two different ways and combinatorial arguments where one sets up bijections between genuinely different sets of objects.

EDIT

Thanks for the answers and comments so far.  Here are two examples that will hopefully clarify what I am asking.  One example of a bijective proof between two different sets are showing that Dyck paths and nonnesting partitions are both Catalan-enumerated objects (even preserving the Narayana statistic with a good bijection).  On the other hand, the identity $\sum_{k=0}^nk{n\choose k}=n2^{n-1}$ is usually proved by describing $k$-subsets of $n$ with a distinguished element in two different ways: in the first way, pick the set then specify the element; in the second way, pick the element then specify the rest of the set.  These are both referred to as bijective or combinatorial proofs, yet somehow they each have a different feel to them.  In the second case, it is pretty easy to see that the two descriptions of these objects yield the same set of objects, but surely there must be more situations where the same set is described in two different ways and the equivalence of their descriptions is difficult to ascertain.  Similarly, there must be times where there are several bijections between different sets, like the first example, where the bijections are the same but not obviously so.  What I am wondering about are examples of these two situations.

A non-combinatorial example of an answer to Q1 is the compact-group vs reflection group definition of the Weyl group of a semi-simple Lie Algebra, where it isn't immediately clear that the same group is obtained.  However, I am looking for more combinatorial examples.

9584,Using a time to set XY chart axis scaling as in Excel 2003,"In Excel 2003, when you created a XY chart using time as an axis, you could set the scaling of the axis by typing in the date. In Excel 2007, you have to use the decimal version of the time (eg. How many days since some arbitrary earlier date).

A developer posted on a blog that this issue would be fixed in a future release, but all versions of Excel 2007 I have tried have not resolved this issue. The relevant quote:


  Those of you familiar with this technique of converting time to a decimal may recall that Excel 2003 allowed you to enter a date and time like “1/1/07 11:00 AM” directly in the  axis option min/max fields and Excel would calculate the appropriate decimal representation.  This currently does not work in Excel 2007 but will be fixed in a subsequent release. 


I was wondering if there was a way to avoid having to make such a calculation?
",CookieOfFortune,https://superuser.com/users/8249,"Excel 2007 has a problem with time as an axis in charts. Using ‘the decimal version of time’ is probably the best workaround.  

The Microsoft blog you refer to closes with:  


  “In summary, whenever you need to create a time series chart where the units are smaller than a day, avoid using line, column, bar, or area chart types. Instead use an XY (Scatter) chart to accurately reflect the span of time.”  


but even so the example used there requires decimal versions.  

As mentioned by @Neal, this has been fixed for Excel 2010, as indicated by Microsoft would be the case. 

Your question also mentions “days since some arbitrary earlier date”. This is a date matter for which no workaround is required when considering whole days. Formatting the source data in date format should be sufficient.

",Dan Blows,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/7762,"Ask a simple question, get a simple answer: it’s because that’s how we speak it in English:


  Today is Thursday, May 24th, 2012.


Now convert the month name to a natural number, and there you have your answer. What’s today’s date?  It’s May 24th.  Instead of writing May-24, we simply change the “May” to “5” and write 5-24 or ⁵⁄₂₄.  

That way it follows the natural language order and so requires no mental gymnastics to switch things around when speaking the date aloud.  Similarly “September 11th” gets written ⁹⁄₁₁, etc.   

The full spoken form with the year, “May 24th, 2012”, then becomes the written shorthand “5/24/2012”, or often just “5/24/12”.  “Christmas of 2001” can be, and somewhat annoying often is, written “12/25/1”, while “January 25th, 2012” becomes “1/25/12”. 

This isn’t usually any sort of problem because of universal consensus on how to interpret such things in the United States.  If you write day/month/year in America, you will not be understood.  Although I myself prefer the ISO notation, normal people do not use it in their daily affairs. 

EDIT

I’ve deleted the rest of the material in case it was distracting the downvoters. 
I have no idea what the downvoters are disagreeing with, since they did not condescend to say why.  The standard and accepted answer as to why Americans write the month first is indeed because they say it first in speech.  A trivial Google comes up with this very same answer repeated dozens and dozens of times. 

I suggest that if you do not like this answer, you do me the courtesy to say why you think this one is wrong. Even better, provide your own answer if you think mine is wrong.

This looks like it should run from a 12V dc supply just fine. With 1A flowing through the 0.47 ohm source resistor this should just about start to turn on the BJT transistor which will hold the gate voltage at the right amount to maintain the 1A thru the LEDs.

Overall volt drop across the MOSFET will be about 0.9V (from a 12V dc supply) so it'll dissipate about 1W in heat - maybe consider a small heatsink.

If the dc supply is more like 15V dc then the MOSFET will get considerably warmer and maybe you should consider using a buck type constant current regulator.

EDIT - check also the maximum current that the LEDs can take - you might be running them too close if the max current is only a bit above 1 A. If this is the case, increase the 0.47 ohm resistor to maybe 0.68 ohm. A little bit of careful testing might be needed.

927,Are there any commercially available crystals in the sub 32 kHz range?,"I'm looking for a low power clocking solution and it looks like crystals bottom out at 32 kHz.  Are there any low power (nA) solutions (crystals/ceramic resonators/custom transistor oscillator circuitry) that operate on nanoAmps of power in the single digit kHz range or lower?

EDIT

I wanted to summarize the facts from the answers below as well as my own research:


Crystals do not commercially exist lower than the standard 32 kHz flavor, due to size/resonance constraints of the quartz used internally (thanks to Olin Lathrop)
For a 32 kHz clock solution in the 100s of nA range, this oscillator IC could be used (thanks to stevenvh)
For lower frequencies (but not necessarily nA current consumption) many silicon oscillators, frequency synthesizers, PLLs, or real time clocks include internal clock divider circuitry and can be used to generate clocks as ""slow"" as 1 Hz.


So there is no solution which satisfies both of the constraints of sub-32 kHz &amp; sub-\$\mu\$A operation, but individual solutions that will satisfy one or the other.
",Joel B,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/1571,"Some manufacturers refer to 100kHz ~ 1.8432MHz as ""very low frequency"". Below 100kHz you'll find only a few specific values like 77.5kHz for (DCF77 receivers) and of course the 32.768kHz watch crystal. You won't find standard crystals below 10kHz.
Nothing lost, by the way. They won't help you meeting your low power requirements, anyway. A crystal needs a certain power to maintain its oscillation, and if you look at the datasheets you'll often see drive levels in the order of 1mW.  

The lowest power microcontroller application using a crystal I designed was an MSP430 running at 32.768kHz, and that used 3\$\mu\$A, a thousand times your requirements.
This oscillator still uses 300nA, that's 0.3\$\mu\$A.

3714,PHP - how to output a MySQL average store rating in a loop,"I have a table with ratings for every store in a directory. I want to display the average rating from each store on a business directory list page. I have the directory business listing page finished without the average rating.

I believe I have figured out how to create an average rating, but I don't know how to get the rating to output in the loop for each store.

Here is how I calculate the rating:

$result = mysql_query(""SELECT AVG(rating) FROM reviews GROUP BY store_id WHERE store_id = '$storeid'"");
$rating_for_page = mysql_fetch_row($result);
$rating = $rating_for_page[0];

",Michael Falciglia,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2069839,"You should iterate through the results if I am understanding the issue correctly. Also, in your MySQL command you need to set an AS for the AVG(rating). And I have set mysql_fetch_assoc (instead of mysql_fetch_row) for the results to be returned in an associative array:

foreach ($storeids as $storeid) {
  $result = mysql_query(""SELECT AVG(rating) AS rating FROM reviews GROUP BY store_id WHERE store_id = '$storeid'"");
  while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
    echo $row['rating'];
  }

EDIT Looking at your query and seeing the $storeid being set, unclear where that value is coming from but I wrapped the solution I have provided in a foreach loop which assumes you have a list—and hopefully an array—that contains all of the $storeids in to loop through.

1325,Are Mintakans related to Vulcans?,"In TNG ""Who Watches the Watchers"" we learn about the Mintakans, who are described as ""proto-Vulcan humanoids"".  Does this mean that the Mintakans come from a common ancestor to the Vulcans, or does it mean that the two species have evolved coincidentally to share many of the same features? (Or not so coincidentally if you take into account that genetic-seeding by the super ancient humanoids.)

We have been shown many species that look completely like humans, and even entire planets that mirror Earth (TOS ""Miri"") and maybe some of those species could be considered ""proto-human humanoids"".

I don't think it has been defined how long Vulcans have had space travel, or if it's even possible the Vulcans evolved from some other species that had space travel earlier, and the Mintakans are some off-shoot of that species.  This could possibly be justified from what Spock says in TOS ""Return to Tomorrow"" where he seems to suggest in response to Sargon and the astrobiology doctor that there are unexplained issues with Vulcans evolving on the planet Vulcan, that they might have been colonized by Sargon's people instead.

Interesting reading:
http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Vulcan_history
",Sean Fahey,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/19629,"Probably not. The Vulcans have historically been very aware (if not forthcoming) about members of their gene pool and where they may be found. In this case, the term Proto-Vulcan humanoid implies the species has many of the same mental, physical and social traits originally seen exhibited by early pre-spaceflight Vulcans. 


This may include psychic ability such as telepathy, logical and disciplined minds, and a superior (to human) physiology. They may also share similar blood chemistry and the ability to be affected by similar diseases.
Since Rombulas (and Remans) WERE once Vulcans they have a direct descent line from the planet Vulcan in the distant past.
The Mintakins were not likely initially Vulcan and may have been descended from Sargon's species before they lost their original bodies. There were also said to have been Proto-Vulcan humanoids.
Other such proto-Vulcan humanoids include the Rigilans and the Halanan.

",user14840,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/14840,"It's not just adding one more electron. Another proton is also added to the nucleus. The overall trend across a row is driven by shielding effects.

In general, as you go across a row, the shielding effect is fairly small compared to the effect of increasing nuclear charge.

As you note, there is a slight deviation in this trend between 5A (i.e., $\ce{N}$) and 6A (i.e., $\ce{O}$) because the extra electron in oxygen is paired. This increases the electron-electron repulsion, so the ionization energy decreases slightly.

As you note, $\ce{F}$ (7A) resumes the overall trend of increasing ionization energy driven by the attractive effects of the higher effective nuclear charge $Z_{eff}$.

R = { (a,b), (a,c), (b,c) }

I know what these relations are all about, but what I have trouble with is how to find them. For example, I see no reflexive relation in the set. Does ""including R"" mean that i can extend R with any element from the given set? So for example, if I am looking for a reflexion can I just add (a, a)?

If I can extend the set, my solution would be:

Reflexive: Add (a,a)
Symmetric: Add (b,a)
Transitive: Already satisfied
Antisymmetric: Already satisfied? I am not sure about this one

",xxsl,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/184856,"You're on the right track. ""Containing"" means just what you would think, since $R$ is a set, we want another set of pairs of elements $(x,y)\in S\times S$ so that $R\subseteq R'$ and $R'$ has one of the properties you mention.

First you need to add $(x,x)$ for every $x\in S=\{a,b,c,d,e\}$ which will give you $R_r=R\cup\{(a,a),(b,b),(c,c), (d,d), (e,e)\}$--the smallest reflexive relation containing $R$.

For a symmetric one, you need to add all of the elements of $R$ where you switch $x$ and $y$, i.e. $R_s=R\cup\{(b,a), (c,a), (c,b)\}$

Continuing for the others, we need a transitive one, so we need to see if there are $xRy$ and $yRz$, and in-fact there is exactly one, namely since $aRb$ and $bRc$ we need to add $aRc$, but you already have $(a,c)\in R$, so $R_t=R$.

Finally anti-symmetry is already satisfied, since there are no $x,y\in S$ such that $xRy$ and $yRx$, so $R=R_a$ is already anti-symmetric. If you have trouble seeing how this is, remember that antisymmetric is parsed in logical symbols as

$$\forall x,y\in S (xRy\land yRx\implies x=y)$$

Since the set of $x,y\in S$ such that $xRy$ and $yRx$ is empty, the condition is vacuously true because all $\forall z\in\varnothing$ statements are vacuously true because the negation is $\exists z'\in\varnothing$ which is clearly false, since there are no elements in an empty set.

\newcommand\TriTri[4]{ 
  \Tri{#1}{#2}{(#3,#4)}
  \Tri{#1}{#2}{(#3+2*#2,#4)}
  \Tri{#1}{#2}{(#3+#2,{sqrt(2*#2*#2)})}} %% note #3+#2 = (x1 + x2)/2 
                                         %% the sqrt bit is sqrt(size^2 + size^2)
}


I have gotten this to work! But what I would like to do is instead of having x and y input separately, I would like to have them input as a coordinate pair. I would like to reference the coordinates as \first,\second.  So that \first(x,y) = x. The desired effect is that

$$\first(1,2)$$


would be the same as

$$1$$

\end{document}


The \Tri command accepts three arguments; the first and the second ones are enclosed in braces, while the third is between parentheses, so

\Tri{a}{3}(0,0)


In the body of the definition you'll use (#3) instead of #3, because the parentheses are stripped off.

In the case of \TriTri we have to split off the two coordinates, so we define four arguments; the first and the second ones are enclosed in braces; the third is what goes from ( to a comma, the final one is everything up to ).

Thus I have modified accordingly your code for \TriTri based on the requirements for \Tri.

",itsols,https://serverfault.com/users/112760,"Thank you to the different users who helped me narrow down the problem. Actually there were multiple issues. I have outline them here as a complete answer and hope someone else may benefit.


like RJS said, I had to put the listen_addresses to accept multiple IPs. This was initially done but later on I realised that the line had a # in front of it which meant it was commented. So I took off the comment.
Even after stopping the PG server, pg_lsclusters showed that there was still a service running. So I couldn't restart it since it reported that it  was already running.
Then by using ps I found that a related program known as pgpool was using the same port and it wouldn't let the default 5432 port to be used by PG. So I stopped this from the terminal using sudo pgpool stop. 
Then I restarted the postgres server and all was fine!

While searching for an answer, I was told by a volunteer RhodiumToad on IRC (#postgresql) that pooling wasn't necessary for what I was doing. I was asked why I have it. The strange thing is that I never installed it. Perhaps pgpool was installed as some addition.
One of the other problems was that I could not get pgadmin to start up on Windows. and correctly connect. There was a libpq.dll missing. Apparently (you'll find another post on stackoverflow about this), the file was there in a few places on Win XP. So I copied all of the postgres DLL files to Windows/System32 and it fixed that.


That's it! Hope this helps.

  How Triangle Law**and **Parallelogram law of addition of Vectors are different?Ain't they.


They are not different.

They are the same thing. There is only one real law which is the head to tail rule. When adding any number vectors put head to tail, head to tail, head to tail... until all the vectors are used up and then draw a line from the tail to the head and that is your resultant vector.

The parallelogram law is essentially just using the triangle law twice in a different order, and they both get the same answer because order does not matter I.E. $\vec A+ \vec B = \vec B + \vec A$.

Here shows the addition of three vectors, the ""triangle"" rule has been used twice in a row to get $\vec A+ \vec B + \vec C = \vec R$. If yo tried to use the parallelogram to get this answer the resulting diagram would be a mess of repeatedly writing the same vector and over.

Then in the template that renders the form check if there is any data in the session.

I can get a video feed only when I open up the laptop.

The audio option from my displays is also gone from the list in Adobe.

855,Creating a static C struct containing strings,"I'm trying to create a dynamic library in Rust that exports a struct as a symbol that will be loaded into a C program via dlopen().

However, I'm was running into some segfaults when accessing the second string in the struct, so I made a small test program to try figure out what I'm doing wrong.

This is the Rust code (test.rs), compiled with ""rustc --crate-type dylib test.rs"":

#[repr(C)]
pub struct PluginDesc {
    name: &amp;'static str,
    version: &amp;'static str,
    description: &amp;'static str
}


#[no_mangle]
pub static PLUGIN_DESC: PluginDesc = PluginDesc {
    name: ""Test Plugin\0"",
    version: ""1.0\0"",
    description: ""Test Rust Plugin\0""
};


and here is the C program that attempts to load the library (test.c), compiled with ""gcc test.c -ldl -o test"":

#include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;


typedef struct {
    const char *name;
    const char *version;
    const char *description;
} plugin_desc;


int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    void *handle;
    plugin_desc *desc;

    handle = dlopen(""./libtest.so"", RTLD_LOCAL | RTLD_LAZY);
    if (!handle) {
        printf(""failed to dlopen: %s\n"", dlerror());
        return 1;
    }

    desc = (plugin_desc *) dlsym(handle, ""PLUGIN_DESC"");
    if (!desc) {
        printf(""failed to dlsym: %s\n"", dlerror());
        return 1;
    }

    printf(""name: %p\n"", desc-&gt;name);
    printf(""version: %p\n"", desc-&gt;version);
    printf(""description: %p\n"", desc-&gt;description);

    return 0;
}


This is the output:

name: 0x7fa59ef8d750
version: 0xc
description: 0x7fa59ef8d75c


As you can see, the address of desc->version is actually 0xc (12), which is the length of the first string. So it looks like the struct that gets packed into the library also contains the string length after the memory address.

Am I using the wrong string type here? As you can see I had to also make the strings NULL terminated manually. I tried to use the CString wrapper but that does not seem to work in this case (""static items are not allowed to have destructors"").

I'm running the latest Rust nightly on Linux:

$ rustc --version
rustc 0.12.0-pre-nightly (f8426e2e2 2014-09-16 02:26:01 +0000)

",chrippa,https://stackoverflow.com/users/4048277,"The short answer is that you can't statically allocate such a struct. Future Rust will probably gain this ability.

What you can do, is statically allocate a struct that contains null pointers, and set those null pointers to something useful when you call the function. Rust has static mut. It requires unsafe code, is not threadsafe at all and is (to the best of my knowledge) considered a code smell.

Right here I consider it a workaround to the fact that there is no way to turn a &amp;[T] into a *const T in a static.

static S: &amp;'static [u8] = b""http://example.org/eg-amp_rust\n\0"";
static mut desc: LV2Descriptor = LV2Descriptor {
    amp_uri: 0 as *const libc::c_char, // ptr::null() isn't const fn (yet)
};

#[no_mangle]
pub extern fn lv2_descriptor(index: i32) -&gt; *const LV2Descriptor {
     let ptr = S.as_ptr() as *const libc::c_char;
     unsafe {
        desc.amp_uri = ptr;
        &amp;desc as *const LV2Descriptor

",AncientSwordRage,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/3804,"The Marvel Wiki entry on Spider-Man's Web-Shooters says this about the web fluid:


  The web fluid is a shear-thinning liquid (virtually solid until a shearing force is applied to it, rendering it fluid) whose exact formula is as yet unknown, but is related to nylon. On contact with air, the long-chain polymer knits and forms an extremely tough, flexible fiber with extraordinary adhesive properties. The web fluid's adhesive quality diminishes rapidly with exposure to air. (Where it does not make contact with air, such as the attachment disk of the web-shooter, it remains very adhesive.) After about one to two hours, certain imbibed esters cause the solid form of the web fluid to dissolve into a powder. Because the fluid almost instantly sublimates from solid to liquid when under shear pressure, and is not adhesive in its anaerobic liquid/solid phase transition point, there is no clogging of the web-shooter's parts.


The Marvel Directory entry on Spider-Man says that Peter Parker intended to imitate spider's silk.


  Parker used equipment borrowed from his high school to fabricate a fluid that imitated a spider's silk web, and spinneret devices to project that fluid from his wrists in the form of a web strand.

The sentence with/without the indefinite article ""a"" before the word ""matter"" is grammatically correct, depending on the sense the word matter is used.  ""Matter"" is used both as a countable noun and uncountable noun.
When you use it as a countable noun to refer to a situation or subject someone needs to deal with, you should use ""a"" before it.  

On the other hand, when you use ""matter"" as an uncountable noun in the sense of substance, material, it doesn't need ""a"" before it such as we discussed certain printing matter.

1340,Are mutliple database calls really significant with a network call for a web API?,"At one of my employers, we worked on a REST (but it also applies to SOAP) API. The client, which is the application UI, would make calls over the web (LAN in typical production deployments) to the API. The API would make calls to the database.

One theme that recurs in our discussions is performance: some people on the team believe that you should not have multiple database calls (usually reads) from a single API call because of performance; you should optimize them so that each API call has only (exactly) one database call.

But is that really important? Consider that the UI has to make a network call to the API; that's pretty big (order of magnitude of milliseconds). Databases are optimized to keep things in memory and execute reads very, very quickly (eg. SQL Server loads and keeps everything in RAM and consumes almost all your free RAM if it can).

TLDR: Is it really significant to worry about multiple database calls when we are already making a network call over the LAN? If so, why?

To be clear, I'm talking about order of magnitude -- I know that it depends on specifics (machine hardware, choice of API and DB, etc.) If I have a call that takes O(milliseconds), does optimizing for DB calls that take an order of magnitude less, actually matter? Or is there more to the problem than this?

Edit: for posterity, I think it's quite ridiculous to make claims that we need to improve performance by combining database calls under these circumstances -- especially with a lack of profiling. However, it's not my decision whether we do this or not; I want to know what the rationale is behind thinking this is a correct way of optimizing web API calls.

Serving reference data again and again and again is a major part of the workload on the system.  All that scheduling of worker threads, acquiring and dropping locks, plan cache checking etc. adds up even if there is not actual disk IO.  Contention is higher because transactions have to hold locks across multiple DB calls and so throughput is much lower than it could be.  Those teams are now looking at having to buy new, very expensive DB servers because of this.

So, although the majority of the elapsed time in your system's current configuration is taken with REST API calls, ignoring performance at the DB level is storing problems for the future.

",Ehizele,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/30970,"The generic formula for sample size at a given power in a regression is 

$$
N = \frac{2.84^2}{p(1-p)}\frac{\sigma^2}{MDE^2}

N is your sample size, p is the proportion getting the treatment, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the residuals, and MDE=the minimum detectable effect that you are powered for.  2.84 comes from alpha confidence of 95% and 80% power.  

The more explanatory factors you've got in your experiment the more $\sigma$ will shrink.  Knowing how much it will shrink is tricky.  

At some point, analytical formulas collapse, and you're better off simply simulating your entire dataset, multiple times doing some sort of monte carlo, and fitting the desired model to each of the plausible datasets.  Your power is the proportion of times you get the result you want.  As with the analytical methods, you're only as good as your assumptions.

But that doesn't really seem to be his role in XCOM. Assault soldiers are better at being in the front lines with their mobility and defensive abilities.

What, then, is the heavy supposed to be doing on the battlefield? What are the general strategies that are useful for heavy soldiers?
",StrixVaria,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/1719,"Hello just reading through all the above and realized that my play style is quite different from most people that have answered this question. Heavies are by far what I call as close as possible to the X-COM the original in the fight against the giant single eye @ Cydonia: You had an inventory grid and I would just cram the soldier with heavy plasma on 1 hand with extra clips, psi amp on the other hand, blaster launcher in back pack, 1st blaster ammo in the back pack, 2nd &amp; 3rd bomb ammo in the belt, an electro flair, and the rest with as many alien grenades and proximity grenades, and the flying suit.

So to mimic the original X-COM I built my heavy with the following skills:
shredder rocket and 1 more rocket giving it a total of 3 blaster bombs.
I gave the heavy grenadier for 2 alien grenades, if only there were prox grenades.
Bullet swarm to mimic auto shot, and rapid reaction - kinda like saving time units for snap shot and just sit in the corners waiting for aliens at the base.

I debated between psi suit vs. archangel suit vs. titan vs. ghost for psi ready soldiers and after some playing around, in the end I went for ghost suit. Ghost suit is just too good as you run as far as u can without triggering the enemy to move, and on the next turn I'd have so many opening moves to choose from: bullet swarm or mind control for single enemies when they are close by, grenade if their clustered but too close to friendlies, or blaster if i can hit a lot without hurting friendlies. 

This was so good I decided to have 4 heavies like this. All 3 heavies go cloak, run in and surprise fireworks. Now the good thing about running into the enemies with ghosted heavies is that you can mind control them and before the control wears off group them up and grenade/blaster bomb em to death or even use their own grenades on em while clustered. So my heavies are the front of the line. I usually go with 4, followed by 2 medics for health patch up. In the end game, it was mandatory to have one of my heavy's go with psi suit as a volunteer, but now I know it's not needed to have the highest will power soldier to finish the game. Although that heavy was kinda fun with 3 blaster bombs and rift. I'd take ghost armor any time. 4 ghosting blaster heavies is a total of 12 blaster bombs per mission, so blasting fun (just remember by late game you have everything you want and you don't need to worry about the loot).

Hence why Vader was angry with his own son for being reminded of the family name.

9341,Understanding the static keyword,"I have some experience in developing with Java, Javascript and PHP.

I am reading Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Step by Step which I feel it is a very good book on introducing you to the C# language.

I seem to be having problems in understanding the static keyword. From what I understand this far if a class is declared static all methods and variable have to be static. The main method always is a static method so in the class that the main method exists all variables and methods are declared static if you have to call them in the main method. Also I have noticed that in order to call a static method from another class you do not need to create an object of that you can use the class name.

What are the advantages of declaring static variables and methods?

When should I declare static variable and methods?
",Nistor Alexandru,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/52164,"Looking at it this way helps me:


Every type has a static instance.
The static instance is created at the first time you access the type -- either through the static instance or creating another instance.
You can create as many non-static instances as you like, but there is only one static instance.
Anything within a class that is declared as static belongs to the static instance, and thus doesn't have access to any other instances you create. But the other instances DO have access to the static instance.
If a class is declared as static then you cannot create other instances, only the static instance can ever exist.
You can declare a static constructor for the static instance just like a constructor for a normal instance (but by declaring it static).


As for when to use the static keyword:


Any method that doesn't need access to local properties can and probably should be declared static.
Helper classes that don't have any state whatsoever (which should be rare anyway) and that will never be mocked can be declared static. Whether they should is another matter; use this functionality sparingly.
Properties and fields that must be accessed by all instances of a class must be declared static. But use this only when there is no other option.

I have listed some numbers

$,..,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,..$

",Fernando Martinez,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/37244,"Your list has absolutely no pattern, because you're doing it ""wrong"", in the sense that you are not writing it in a way that a pattern emerges. 

Of course there is no order preserving function, so writing both sets with their natural order will promise you that there is no reasonable pattern. Instead write the natural numbers, and then try to write the integers:

$$\begin{array}
&amp; 1 &amp; 2&amp;  3&amp;  4&amp;  5&amp; 6&amp;  7&amp; 8&amp;\ldots\\

This gives rise to a bijection from $\Bbb N$ onto $\Bbb Z$. Now just find its inverse.

913,What's the deal with alignment languages?,"In early D&amp;D, there was the concept of an ""alignment language."" 

The original ""little brown book"" D&amp;D says only:


  Law, Chaos and Neutrality also have common languages spoken by each respectively.


The Holmes basic rules, which come between ""brown book"" and Moldvay say: 


  Lawful good, lawful evil, chaotic good, chaotic evil, and neutrality also have common languages spoken by each respectively. One can attempt to communicate through the common tongue, language particular to a creature class, or one of the divisional languages (lawful good, etc.). While not understanding the language, creatures who speak a divisional tongue will recognize a hostile one and attack.


Moldvay D&amp;D says:


  Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Basic Rules, page B11
  
  Alignment Languages
  
  Each alignment has a secret language of passwords, hand signals, and other body motions.  Player characters and intelligent monsters will always know their alignment languages.  They will also recognize when another alignment language is being spoken, but will not understand it.  Alignment languages are not written down, nor may they be learned unless a character changes alignment.  When this happens, the character forgets the old alignment language and starts using the new one immediately.


What?

So much of Dungeons and Dragons was very generic ""sword and sorcery"" fantasy that these rules always stuck out to me as an extremely sore thumb, or like one of those snails that has been infected by a fungus and begins to pulsate in random colors.  What the heck is going on here?

So, alignment languages show up pretty early in D&amp;D's history.  Every intelligent being that is on the side of Law can communicate.  Every intelligent being that has no particular feelings about Law can, too.  If they experience a profound change in their feelings about this, they can no longer communicate with the people they used to.  It isn't clear how much communication is possible in an alignment language, since Moldvay describes it as ""passwords, hand signals, and other body motions.""

In AD&amp;D 1E, though, there is no such limitation:


  Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, page 34
  
  Character Languages
  
  In addition to the common tongue, all intelligent creatures able to converse in speech use special languages particular to their alignment. These alignment languages are: Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Good, Chaotic Neutral, lawful Evil, Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, Neutral Evil, Neutral Good, and Neutrality. The alignment of your character will dictate which language he or she speaks, for only one alignment dialect can be used by a character (cf. CHARACTER CLASSES, The Assassin). If a character changes alignment, the previously known longuage is no longer able to be spoken by him or her.


That cross-reference to the assassin class is there because assassins alone can learn the languages of other alignments.  Probably not all of them, though, because now there are nine instead of three.

In AD&amp;D 2E, the alignment language seems to have been silently dropped, and never spoken of again as far as I know.

When I was ten and played AD&amp;D, the idea of alignment languages struck me as incomprehensible, and today even though I have come to love almost everything about basic and early-Advanced D&amp;D, alignment languages still seem incomprehensible, weird, and unexplained.

What I want to know is this: how were (or are) alignment languages put to use, described, and conceived of in actual play ?  So far, my use of them has always been ""pretend they do not exist.""  I am curious as to how others view and address them.

Also:  where did this bizarre idea come from?  It smacks of being lifted from some fantasy book, but I can't recall ever reading anything like it.
",rjbs,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/54,"There are hundreds of languages in daily use throughout the real world, but the syntax, words, and omissions of terms reflect the worldviews of the users. As simple examples, consider the Russian discourtesy toward indefinite articles, use of tonalities in Sinitic tongues, and words denoting relations in various languages (can you say 'brother-in-law' in a single word?).

When certain terms are favored over others, those choices may indicate one's worldview. Similarly certain physical gestures could indicate one's state of mind (orderly, caring, malicious, self-absorbed, etc.). When Gary used the D&amp;D game to introduce alignment concepts of Law/Chaos (and later adding Good/Evil to the mix), Alignment Languages were an early and under-developed side effect. 

A logical argument could be made that one's alignment could be revealed to all by these unconscious word choices and gestures, and the end result of that logic is the ""Know Alignment"" spell, in which a cleric's perceptions are magically boosted to translate all such clues. (For implementation, however, the spell works without requiring such interaction.)

In actual use in the 1970s and early 1980s, Alignment Communications (whether verbal or otherwise) were incidental tools used to supplement communication already in progress. If you were conversing with a stranger in Common, you could 'slip in' a bit of alignment, to either augment or corroborate the usual discourse. Moral extremists (paladins, assassins, et al.) tended to make such attempts more frequently than others. And in any event, this nonmagical information-gathering was always indicative at most, never reached the level of detail gained by the use of the magical spell.

77,AES using derived keys / IVs. Does it introduce a weakness?,"I'm looking for an efficient way to encrypt multiple fields in a database with AES using a single global key, used throughout a large web application.

Obviously in order to re-use this key, a unique random IV is required for each field that is to be encrypted.

I'd rather not introduce more fields to the database to store each of these IVs, so the programatic approach seems to be to derive these IVs some how.

I'm toying with using either:

key = sha256(global_key + table_name)
iv = sha256(column_name + primary_key)


Or even simply:

key = global_key
iv = sha256(table_name + column_name + primary_key)


I'm leaning towards the former to generate per-table keys.

I've already read that the IVs do not need to be kept secret. So I'm working on the assumption that a derived key or IV (even if the algorithm becomes known), is no more insecure than any other non-secret IV, as long as the original key remains secret.

The question is:

Is there a fatal flaw in my approach? Am I introducing any serious weaknesses that, in the event that an adversary obtains a copy of the database, would make it easier for them to retrieve the plaintext data?

I realise that is potentially soliciting one word answers.

Suggestions for alternate / better schemes very much welcomed, as well as references to existing works and how they implement similar scenarios.
",Leigh,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/1349,"A potentially better approach would be to store the IV and ciphertext in one column. This way, you can generate IVs in the way most appropriate for your choice of encryption mode while also not having to add columns.

What's the best solution to detect the power outage on the mains with the microcontroller?

",m.Alin,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/4906,"Since you also need the zero-crossing you'll get the power outage detection virtually for free.
Best is to use an optocoupler to detect zero-crossings. Put the mains voltage via high resistance resistors to the input of the optocoupler. Vishay's SFH6206 has two LEDs in anti-parallel, so it works over the full cycle of the mains voltage.  



If the input voltage is high enough the output transistor is switched on, and the collector is at a low level. Around the zero crossing, however, the input voltage is too low to activate the output transistor and its collector will be pulled high. So you get a positive pulse at every zero crossing. The pulse width depends on the LEDs' current. Never mind if it's more than 10% duty cycle (1ms at 50Hz). It will be symmetrical about the actual zero-crossing, so the exact point is in the middle of the pulse.   

To detect power outages you (re)start a timer on every zero-crossing, with a timeout at 2.5 half cycles. Best practice is to let the pulse generate an interrupt. As long as the power is present the timer will be restarted every half cycle and never time out. Upon a power outage however, it will timeout after a bit longer than a cycle, and you can take the appropriate action. (The timeout value is longer than 2 half cycles, so that a spike on 1 zero-crossing causing a missed pulse won't give you a false warning.)
If you create a software timer it won't cost you anything, but you can also use a retriggerable monostable multivibrator (MMV), for instance with an LM555.  

note: depending on your mains voltage and the resistor type you may need to place two resistors in series for the optocoupler, because the high voltage may cause a single resistor to breakdown. For 230V AC I've used three 1206 resistors in series for this.  



Q &amp; A time! (from comments, this is extra, in case you want more)  

Q: And the input LEDs of the optocoupler will work at 230V? The datasheet states that the forward voltage is 1.65V.
A: Like for a common diode the voltage over a LED is more or less constant, no matter what your supply voltage is. The mandatory series resistor will take the voltage difference between power supply and LED voltage. The answers to this question explain how to calculate the resistor's value. Extreme example: a 10 000V power supply for a 2V LED. Voltage over the resistor: 10 000V - 2V = 9 998V. You want 20mA? Then the resistor is \$\frac{9 998V}{20mA}\$ = 499.9k\$\Omega\$. That's 500k, that's even reasonable. Yet, you can't use an ordinary resistor here. Why not? Firstly, a common 1/4W PTH resistor is rated at 250V, and will definitely breakdown at 10 000V, so you'll have to use 40 resistors in series to distribute the high voltage. Secondly, and worse, the power that the resistor would have to dissipate is \$P = V \times I = 9 998V \times 20mA = 199.96W\$, a lot more than the rated 1/4W. So to cope with the power we'll even need 800 resistors. OK, 10kV is extreme, but the example shows that you can use any voltage for a LED, so 230V is also possible. It's just a matter of using enough and the right type of resistors.  

Q: How does the reverse voltage affect the lifetime of the LEDs?
A: The second, anti-parallel LED takes care of that by ensuring that the reverse voltage over the other LED can't become higher than its own forward voltage. And that's a good thing, because a reverse voltage of 325V\$_P\$ would kill any LED (most likely explode), just like any signal diode, by the way. The best way to protect it is a diode in anti-parallel.  

Q: Won't the resistors dissipate a lot of heat?
A: Well, let's see. If we assume 1mA through the resistors and ignore the LED voltage, we have \$P = V \times I = 230V_{RMS} \times 1mA = 230mW\$, so even a 1206 can handle that. And remember, we're using more than 1 resistor, so we're safe if we can work with 1mA (The SFH6206 has a high CTR \$-\$ Current Transfer Ratio).

2155,Idolatry in churches allowed?,"It is very frequent to see idols of Jesus or any biblical entities in  a Church , So is such idolatry allowed by  the bible,considering the following verses?


  ""You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea"".
  Exodus 20:4


History tells us that:


  sometimes objects that God instructed to be made were turned into
  idols by the Israelites. The Book of Numbers contains a narrative in
  which God instructed Moses to make a bronze snake as part of
  addressing a plague of venomous snakes that had broken out among the
  Israelites as a punishment for sin. The bronze snake is mentioned
  again in 2 Kings 18; however, rather than remaining a memorial of
  God's providence, it became an idol that the people named and
  worshiped. Thus the bronze snake was destroyed in King Hezekiah's
  reforms.


More specifically in India I see Christians carry idols of Jesus and other biblical  entities with them kiss them and revere them too. Infact they allow the Hindus in the Church and let them perform worship in their way(Like putting incense sticks, offering flowers , foodstuff to the Idol of Jesus etc) as shown below a very common view in India. I studied in a Christian school for 10 years and i am yet to see Christians not doing these things.

I have seen the same on TV and in videos of people venerating the Idol of biblical entities.


",JesusBoughtIslam,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/3812,"You're operating under a misconception that these are idols. Most Christians don't worship these images, statues, etc. Instead, they are considered art, something that we  create because we love the subject, not the work of art.

Asking your question is like asking if looking at a painting of my wife means that I am allowed to cheat on her by devoting my affection to an image of her. I love her, not the painting of her. Christians love Jesus, not the statues of Him.

So, the answer id no, idolatry isn't allowed in Churches.  

Addressing the updates to the question, the things that people are ""venerating"" are likely ""Sacrementals"".


  Sacramentals are material objects, things or actions (sacramentalia) set apart or blessed by the Roman and Eastern Catholic
  Churches, the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Church of
  the East, the Anglican Churches, the Independent and Old Catholic
  Churches, and the Lutheran Churches to manifest the respect due to the
  sacraments, and so to excite good thoughts and to increase devotion,
  and through these movements of the heart to remit venial sin,
  according to the Council of Trent (Session XXII, 15).
  
  In Roman Catholicism, sacramentals such as Holy water, the crucifix or
  the Saint Benedict Medal are recommended as a means of protection
  against evil.


Again, the devotion is not to these things, but to the God they represent. There are, those that do worship them like idols, and many view the idea that these could protect us from evil as superstitious, the point remains that officially, these aren't idols. They aren't to be worshiped. They are reminders of the one we should be worshiping.

",NikolaiDante,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/8413,"Just rereading the series from the beginning after reading AMoL. From Moiraine's discussion with Thom in TSR Ch. 17, we might infer at least two questions:


She has asked about her fate and the fate of her companions from her assertion that she can promise Thom that he will not die in Tanchico and that they will meet again because he will survive Tarabon (p. 245-246). Does she know how much later they will meet again at this point? Not sure, but such knowledge might help to stiffen her resolve about how she will deal with Lanfear after she goes through the rings in Rhuidean. Inferring the question was about more than Thom because she seems to know in a way that exceeds mere caution that Ny and El will need some help staying alive in Tanchico (and along the way back).
She asked about Owyn's circumstances. No evidence before or since that she had collected this info elsewhere. (Not that we ever get the answer...) I've looked at the phrasing carefully, and I don't think she's using sleight of tongue here to suggest she has info that she doesn't. Plus Thom perceives sympathy and regret from her, though he tries to deny it. This tracks with her knowing about this tragedy in her future sweetie's past.


Granted, these are inferences, but now that we know all we're going to get except info to be dropped in the forthcoming Encyclopedia, they fit the story. Moiraine has known about the doorframe for some time now. I can picture her formulating a first question with exact wording, and then having a path A/B/C for the other two depending on the answer to the first (as opposed to Mat's just blurting out what's on his mind at the time).

The targeted machine is EFI.
grub is either never installed on the target or has been utterly wiped from the system.


it can only ever interfere and offers nothing of value otherwise.



So what we might do in the above case is configure a boot option for a small installation/rescue image we keep on our /esp or EFI system partition.

If anything were ever to go wrong with our current installation, then, for so long as we can at least access the EFI system partition by some means, then we can interface our firmware and set the machine to boot to our recovery image on next reboot. In that case all we would have to do is change a text file or two, cross our fingers and run reboot now.

Here is a basic set of commands for a minimally configured Arch Linux (because it's what I use) system which could still do as I describe.


First, we'll make a work directory and download some files.


I use aria2c here. I recommend it, but use whatever works.
I unzip rEFInd with 7za but the same
tool preference is yours in all cases here.
If you're not reading this within a few hours/days of my posting it, then there is a very good chance that the links used below are not current.

Next I'll make an image disk.


I use a file here with loop devices, but you may want to use an actual disk if you want to boot to this from firmware.
In the case of an actual device the fallocate and losetup stuff can be ignored and the actual device names will far more likely
correspond to /dev/sda[12] than /dev/loop0p[12]

fallocate -l4G img


Now I'll partition that disk with the gdisk utility and assign it to a loop device.


This is a scripted shortcut for the options you'd want to feed the program interactively. It will create a GUID partition table and a partition of type EFI-system that spans the first available 750Mib of the target disk and another linux default partition spanning the rest of the disk.


These partitions will be /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 respectively if you're using a real disk, which will be /dev/sda rather than ./img. It is usually desirable to add more than one partition for a linux root, which is assumed to be the purpose of /dev/sda2.

printf script or no, the gdisk program is easy to use - and so you might do better to go at it interactively instead. The target disk should not be mounted when it is run, and you'll probably need root rights to write the changes.
As a general rule you can do pretty much whatever you want in that program without any effect until you write - so be sure when you do.
I'll be putting my $TGT in a shell variable. Except for its definition here, which you may want to tailor as necessary, where I use it so can you.

printf %s\\n o y n 1 '' +750M ef00 \
                 n 2 '' '' '' '' w y |
gdisk ./img     &gt;/dev/null
TGT=$(sudo losetup --show -Pf img)p


We'll need a filesystem on the esp, too. It must be FAT.


I give mine the fs label VESP. You should call yours whatever you want.
We'll use the label later in /etc/fstab and another config file - so definitely make it something.
In my opinion you should always label all disks.
If you install an OS to ${TGT}2 now you will of course need a filesystem for it as well.

sudo mkfs.vfat -nVESP ""$TGT""1


And we'll make some mount directories and start extracting the relevant files.

   set     ref     ref*iso         \
        arch    arch*iso        \
        efi     arch/EFI/archiso/efiboot.img
while   [ ""$#"" -gt 0 ]
do      mkdir ""$1"" || exit
        sudo mount ""$2"" ""$1""
        shift 2
done;   mkdir esp

Install rEFInd...


rEFInd is a boot manager - which mostly just offers and populates boot menus.
rEFInd will put its config files on the esp and these can be edited at any time and anyway you like.

sudo ref/install.sh --usedefault ""$TGT""1 &amp;&amp;
sudo umount ref  &amp;&amp; rm -rf ref*


Now we'll mount our esp and get the needed files off of the Arch install disk to get our own live bootable rescue disk.


Most live disks implement a sort of ugly hack to make the flat, unpartitioned iso filesystem look like an acceptable boot device to a UEFI system while still maintaining backwards compatibility w/ BIOS systems.
Arch Linux is no exception.
This ugly hack is that efiboot.img currently mounted on ./efi. It's where we'll find our kernel and initramfs image file. The other ones on the disk (in ./arch/arch/boot) will not work for EFI systems.

sudo sh -ec    &lt;&lt;CONF '
     mount    ""$1"" esp
     cp -ar    efi/EFI/archiso esp/EFI
     cp -ar    arch/arch/*x86* esp/EFI/archiso

You have essentially just installed - from the ground up - a pre-boot rescue environment with a persistent copy-on-write save file (so you might, for example systemctl enable sshd_socket now and the setting would persist in the live system's next boot). The Arch Linux live install media now resides on your system's boot partition and can be called from the boot menu at any time. Of course, you also installed the boot menu manager.


A couple of things about the above should stand out to you:


I use *x86* because I have a 64-bit machine and that glob gets what I need. For a 32-bit installation (but why?) use *686* instead.


What I need, by the way, is a total of only 7 files and approximately 300M.
The live-system's rootfs is the squashed image in esp/EFI/archiso/x86_64/airootfs.sfs.

I specify the disk by label. There are no hints or other such nonsense - the disk is named and so it is easily found. You'll need to substitute in whatever you chose for an esp label instead of VESP.
The copytoram kernel parameter instructs the Arch Linux live init system to copy its rootfs image into a tmpfs before loopmounting it - which frees you actually to access the esp when working in that environment. Most live install systems offer similarly arranged constructs.



Where EFI shines is in its ability to handle a filesystem. On modern computers there is absolutely no need to pack some raw binary and wedge it in between your disk partitions. It astounds me that people still do, when, instead, they could manage and configure their boot environment with simple text files arranged in a regular, everyday directory tree. Above I put the kernel and initramfs in their own named folder in a central tree structure. The EFI - which will take its cues from rEFInd in this case for convenience - will invoke that at boot by pathname because it mounts the esp.

Now all that is left to do is to ensure you understand how to select the system which will actually boot when you need to. Understand - you can boot this right now. You can do it in a virtual machine w/ qemu (you'll need OVMF -pflash firmware) or you can reboot your computer and rEFInd will detect the kernel and pass its pathname to the firmware which will load and execute the Arch Linux live system. When you install a more permanent system on the disk - or several (which you can do right now if you so choose by rebooting to the live disk and performing the installation) - you'll want to keep its kernel and initramfs in the same structure. This is very easily arranged.


If, for example, you were to install a system on a root partition named, for lack of an imagination, root, you'd want to set it up something like this:


mount --bind its particular boot folder over the root /boot path in /etc/fstab.
You'll need two lines in /etc/fstab and to create a mount point in /esp to handle this.

sudo sh -c          &lt;&lt;\FSTAB     '
     [ -d /esp ]    || mkdir /esp
     findmnt   /esp || mount -L ESP /esp
     mkdir -p  /esp/EFI/root
     cp        /boot/kernel binary   \
               /boot/initramfs.img   \
               /esp/EFI/root
     mount -B  /esp/EFI/root /boot
     cat   &gt;&gt;  /etc/fstab
     echo ""$1""&gt;/boot/refind_linux.conf
' -- '""new_menu_item"" ""root=LABEL=root""'
LABEL=ESP       /esp    vfat    defaults        0 2
/esp/EFI/root   /boot   none    bind,defaults   0 0
FSTAB




You only ever have to do anything like that once per installation - and that is assuming you didn't set it up that way in the first place - which is easier because the kernel and initramfs will already be where they belong. Once you've got those lines in /etc/fstab and a minimal config file in /boot/refind_linux.conf you're set for good. You can support as many installations as you like on the same system with the same /esp device and centralize all bootable binaries in the same tree just like that. Different
systems will do things a little differently - Windows takes a little more cajoling to get it to conform, for example - but they will all work.


Ok, the last thing you need to know, as I said before, is how choose the  next booting installation from the filesystem. This is configured in the  file /esp/EFI/BOOT/refind.conf.


You should read this file - it's probably 99% comment and will  tell you all about what you might do with it.
Of course, you don't really have to do anything - by default rEFInd will boot the most recently updated kernel in its scan tree.
But I usually wind up setting the following options:

&lt;&lt;\DEF sudo tee \
       /esp/EFI/BOOT/refind.conf.def
### refind.conf.def
### when renamed to refind.conf this file
### will cause refind to select by default
### the menu item called ""new_menu_item""
### in its /boot/refind_linux.conf
default_selection new_menu_item
### this file will also set the menu timeout
### to only 5 seconds at every boot
timeout 5
### END
DEF

And the rescue file...

&lt;&lt;\RES sudo tee \
       /esp/EFI/BOOT/refind.conf.res
### refind.conf.res
### this one will default to selecting
### the entry named ""arch_iso"" with a
### 10 second timeout
default_selection arch_iso
timeout 10
### END
RES



And so now you can just move them around.
For example, to make the rescue environment definitely boot after you do reboot now...




sudo cp /esp/EFI/BOOT/refind.conf.res \
        /esp/EFI/BOOT/refind.conf



And substitute .def for the .res used above, of course, to go back to default root.

8831,"What is the difference between unicast, anycast, broadcast and multicast traffic?","I have never had the privilege of working in an environment that required complicated routing or if it did require it, it was handled upstream of me. I've always used very simple static routing configurations and never needed to do any multipath routing -- hence my general confusion regarding this subject. I would like to understand multicasting and anycasting better. 


What is the difference between unicast, anycast, broadcast and multicast traffic?
What situations are they generally used in and why (e.g., what applications use which method)?
How do you calculate how much broadcast traffic is too much for a given network segment or broadcast domain?
What are the security implications of allowing broadcast and multicast traffic?

",kce,https://serverfault.com/users/62491,"Here's some basic info:

Unicast: Unicast traffic is traffic that is meant for a single host. All other hosts will ignore unicast traffic not meant for themselves. In a switched environment, unicast traffic is generally not ""heard"" by any hosts other than the host that the traffic is intended for. In an environment that uses hubs (shudder) all hosts will ""hear"" unicast traffic meant for every other host, but they'll ignore all traffic not intended for themselves.

Broadcast: Broadcast traffic is traffic that is sent with the intent of being ""heard"" by all hosts on a particular network segment. Examples of broadcast traffic would be an ARP request, which is a broadcast at the physical layer (MAC address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) or a NetBIOS name query, which is a broadcast at the network layer (whatever happens to be the broadcast address for that particular network, such as 64.28.42.63 for the network 64.28.42.0/26).

Multicast: Multicast traffic is traffic that is sent with the intent of being ""heard"" by a particular group of hosts on a network segment. Some multicast traffic can be considered broadcast traffic, such as traffic to the multicast address 224.0.0.1, which is multicast traffic meant for all hosts on the same network segment. Another example of multicast traffic would be traffic sent to the multicast address 224.0.0.9 which is what RIP routers use to send routing information to other RIP routers on the same network segment.

I'll leave Anycast to someone else as I really don't know that much about it.

Conditionals of the first kind are \@ifundefined and \@ifpackageloaded; among the second kind are \@ifpackagelater and \@ifpackagewith.

I want to avoid hard-coding data in the router and specifying the same data more than once (in the router and in the controller and/or view).

(Explanation follows; perhaps there is a better way to do what I'm trying to do.)

I have a site where I publish my freeware apps. The site is all static, but maintaining plain html by hand is a nightmare, so I'm trying to use CodeIgniter to generate the pages dynamically. Apart from a few loose ends like 'welcome' or 'contact info', the bulk of the site consists of highly structured application sections. Each app has the same set of pages: about, download, screenshots, etc. These pages all have the same exact layout and only differ in contents.

My main concern is maintainability and the amount of work that required to add a new app (or a new page for all apps). I see no reason to use multiple controllers (or even multiple views), because the only difference is in data (application identifiers), not in behavior or page layout.

My problem is with routing. I could do something like

$route['app1'] = 'main/apps/app1';
$route['app2'] = 'main/apps/app2';


...or loop over an array of app identifiers, but that seems really bad. When I add an application, I should not have to modify the router, since it's just another identifier added to a list, that will be used to pick page contents from an appropriate file.

What I would like to do instead is (pseudocode):

foreach (app in list_of_apps) {
  foreach (app_page in list_of_pages) {
    route['app/app_page'] = 'main/index/app/app_page'
  }
}


This would take care of all requests for 'app1/download' or 'app2/screenshots', etc. So where can I declare the arrays $list_of_apps and $list_of_pages so that they are visible in the router, in the controller, and later in view as well?
",Marek Jedliński,https://stackoverflow.com/users/9226,"This should be a simple regular expressions solution:

// set this to whatever controller/method you want as the index for the app
$route['([^/])']      = 'main/apps/$1';

// this is a sample ""subpage"" handler
$route['([^/])/(.*)'] = 'main/index/$1/$2';


If all ""apps"" follow the same URL structure, it shouldn't be too hard to make this very modular.

1779,STFT - DFT size of the bins,"Having some trouble understanding this concept, really could do with some advice.

I want my STFT to have the following parameters: NFFT = 256 overlap/hop = 128

Now essentially, the algorithm will work as follows:

1) Split the signal into blocks of 256 


This will result in around 72*265:

2) For each of these blocks, calculate against the Hanning Window 

3) Create a ""slider"" that does an overlap of 128.. So, in theory it would 
   therefore be: `size = 256 + 128` 


Therefore, when I'm computing the DFT for each of the overlapped blocks, will my FFT remain at size 256 or will the size be 256 + 128 If this is the case, does each block in the resulting vector still have to be of size 256?

Thanks  

EDIT: 

This is now my result:



But, compare this to a spectrogram in matplotlib



Where am I actually going wrong? I cannot make any sense of this. 

I've looked bat through all the data, the blocks are correctly overlapping, Hanning window is being applied correctly.

Could it be to do with the fact I'm using a 1D DFT? I.e. 

std::vector&lt;complex&gt; FFT-&gt;transform(complex_vector[0...n], 256);

",Phorce,https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/5182,"For a non-zero overlap, the size of each FFT will remain exactly the same.  However some of the data points used in each successive FFT will be from the previous FFT window, thus allowing less completely new data points to make up the final length to be fed to that successive FFT.  Thus more overlap will create a larger number of blocks.

For an overlap of 128, the 2nd FFT uses 128 points from the end of the first FFT, and adds 128 new points from the data stream, to make up a total of 256 data points, the same length as the first FFT.  Rinse and repeat.  The number of blocks for 50% overlap will approach double that of the number for zero overlap.

8882,Server compromised - How do I find out what is sending mail,"A friend of mine has a few small businesses and hosts Wordpress-based sites for them on a dedicated host. The Wordpress installs were neglected for awhile and the host ended up getting compromised. There's now 100's of spam messages going out every second. What can I look at to determine what's generating the mail?

The only way I can get the spam to stop is to shutdown Postfix. We've had it off for a few days to prevent spamming, but this also means he can't send mail from his businesses addresses.

If I shutdown both apache and postfix, netstat shows no remote connections except my SSH login. If I then start postfix (but leave apache stopped), 100's of remote connections to port 25 immediately open. This leads me to believe that some process on the host is doing this, rather than something coming in through Wordpress/some rogue script that we missed in the clean-up. There were also IRC bots on here, but we've removed those, and netstat no longer shows any open connections to IRC.

When I look at ps axjf - all of the smtp processes roll up to /usr/libexec/postfix/master, which has a parent id of 1. This doesn't really give me an idea of where the mail is being generated.

Neither ps nor top show any suspicious processes (as far as I can tell).

What else can I look at to see what's creating/sending the mail? I can post the output of ps whatever_flags_you_want both with and without postfix running, if it will help.

Is my stenography easy to detect? And what would it take to conceal it? 
",Ahmed Ihsan Tawfeek,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/12003,"A general theoretical answer to the title's What makes LSBit steganography detectable? is that in normal images, the LSBit of a pixel in some channel is correlated to higher-order bits in the same pixel and channel, that pixel in other channels, and adjacent pixels, in ways that mere replacement of LSBit tends to strongly alter.

One simple way to improve that is adding noise or blurr to a degree such that the LSBit is nearly indistinguishable from random, in which case it can then be replaced by something equally indistinguishable from random (as resulting from good encryption) with little chance of detection versus an equally noisy/blurry image. Next step is changing only few bits at locations dependent on a key (towards that goal it is necessary to have a small payload, as previously pointed), and have the other pixels randomly noisy according to a good model of the natural image.

From a practical standpoint, sending uncompressed 24-bit bitmap images somewhat is a red flag that basic stego is in use. That would be somewhat less apparent with an additional step of JPEG lossless compression, or PNG or GIF conversion (lossy compression would destroy the hidden message given the LSBit encoding used; more sophisticated stenographic schemes survive that). Notice that sending noisy/blurry images without lossy compression is a waste of bandwidth, and could also raise alarm.

I suggest two ""easy to detect"" tests, to be applied comparatively on your image with stego (after decompression if a lossless compression step is added), and normal images that could be allegedly sent, at least including the one you start from.


Show as an 8-color image the 3 LSBits of each pixel; that can be done by changing each byte x in each RGB plane to ~((x&amp;1)-1). It there something perceptibly remarkable for your image with stego? Update: a 64 or 512-color image using (x&lt;&lt;6)+32 or (x&lt;&lt;5)+16 might also be interesting. (note:  the three expressions are for C, and assume truncation to octet. ~((x&amp;1)-1) yields 0x00 if the low bit of x is clear, 0xFF otherwise).
Is the compression ratio of PNG markedly lower for your image with stego than for normal images?


Note that these tests can only demonstrate failure to be undetectable.

",Nick C,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/373,"Using the new pump, you are able to determine the size of its large nut. It is either 34 or 36mm across the flats.

With the 'spanner' on the nut and with a engineers hammer, strike the improvised spanner to undo the nut. The inertia of the assembly allows it to come undone.

6188,What is the cardinality of the family of unlabelled bipartite graphs on n vertices?,"I have attempted to calculate the number of unlabelled bipartite graphs as follows:


  Let $G = (V_1, V_2, E)$ be a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with $|V_1| = m$ and $|V_2| = n-m$. Assume without loss of generality that $|V_1| \leq |V_2|$ so $m \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor$. If $G$ is complete bipartite then it has $m(n-m)$ edges since each of the vertices in $V_1$ is connected to each in $V_2$. Thus, the total number of bipartite graphs with parts of size $m$ and $n-m$ is $2^{m(n-m)}$. In order to find the total number of possible bipartite graphs on $n$ vertices we sum over all possible $m$:
  \begin{align}
\sum^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}_{m=1} 2^{m(n-m)}
\end{align}


However, I notice that I have counted labelled bipartite graphs where I need the number of unlabelled graphs. I'm struggling to see how to account for this.
",Andrew,https://mathoverflow.net/users/31128,"In the formalism of species of structure. The species $Bip(X,Y)$ of bipartite graphs on two sorts of vertex $X$ and $Y$ can be described as,
$$
Bip(X,Y) \simeq E^2 \circ (E^\bullet(X) E^\bullet(Y)) \simeq E^2 \circ (XY E(X + Y))
$$
where $E$ is the species of sets, $\circ$ is the functorial composition of species and $\bullet$ is the pointing operator.

If I make no mistake the series you search is,
$$
Bip(x,y) = \prod_{k \ge 1}\exp\left[\frac{2}{k}x^ky^k\prod_{l \ge 1} \exp\left(\frac{1}{l}(x^{kl}+y^{kl}) \right)\right]

Hope this helps.

Edit : Doing the computations I find,
\begin{align*}
Bip(xt,yt) &amp;=
1+2xy{t}^{2}+ \left( 2y{x}^{2}+2{y}^{2}x \right) {t}^{3}+
 \left( 5{y}^{2}{x}^{2}+2y{x}^{3}+2{y}^{3}x \right) {t}^{4} + ...

4440,Fiona - Preffered method for defining a schema,"I'm fairly new to the world of python and GIS - so this is definitely a beginner question.

I am following Tom Macwrights small guide to Shapely and Fiona, and I noticed that even when opening the previously created shapefile, it doesn't contain the schema I defined using:

schema = { 
      'geometry': 'Point', 
      'properties': { 'name': 'str' } }


This is evident because when I try to call it using schema = input.schema.copy(), it spits out AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'schema'

Reading the Fiona documentation, it states that:


  the schema of its record type (a vector file has a single type of record, remember) is accessed via a read-only schema attribute. 


Does that mean that it is not possible to store a schema in the shapefile,a nd therefore I'm always required set up the variables in the beginning, rather than reading from the file using input.schema.copy()? Or do I setup the schema using Records? 

If so, how do you read from a csv file (as in Tom's example) and place the data into the records to be read from input.schema.copy()? is it helpful to do this, or am I just complicating things and should define the schema every time i open the shapefile?

Thanks for the help - I'm really interested in developing my understanding of the processes occurring.
",coreyjames,https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/23073,"I don't really understand your problem. Some explanations: for example, we want to


create a new shapefile
modify the original schema: for that, it's easier to just copy things to a new shapefile and make the changes as you copy


Create a new Polyline shapefile:



import fiona
# schema: it is a simple dictionary with geometry and properties as keys
schema = {'geometry': 'LineString','properties': {'test': 'int'}}
# for defining the geometry, you need Shapely
from shapely.geometry import LineString, mapping
# two simples geometries
lines = [LineString([(272830.63,155125.73),(273770.32,155467.75)]),LineString([(273536.47,155914.07),(272033.12,152265.71)])]
with fiona.open('myshp.shp', 'w', 'ESRI Shapefile', schema) as layer:
    for line in lines:
        # filling schema
        elem = {}
        # geometry with mapping function of shapely
        elem['geometry'] = mapping(line) 
        # attribute value (the same here)
        elem['properties'] = {'test': 145}
        # writing element in the file
        layer.write(elem)



Now we want to modify the schema of the original shapefile in a new shapefile:


1) Open the original shapefile:

shapefile =fiona.open('myshp.shp')
#read the schema
schema2 = shapefile.schema
print schema2
{'geometry': 'LineString', 'properties': OrderedDict([(u'test', 'int:10')])}


2) As it is a dictionary, it is easy to add new fields/keys in the properties:

schema2['properties']['string']='str'


3) Now we create a new shapefile copying myshp.shp with the new schema :

with fiona.open('myshp.shp', 'r') as input:
    schema = schema2
    # writing the new shapefile
    with fiona.open('myshp_copy.shp', 'w', 'ESRI Shapefile', schema) as output:
        for elem in input:
            # add the new attribute value
            elem['properties']['string']=""hello""
            output.write({'properties': elem['properties'],'geometry': mapping(shape(elem['geometry']))})



verification


c = fiona.open('myshp_copy.shp')
c.schema
{'geometry': 'LineString', 'properties': OrderedDict([(u'test', 'int:10'), (u'string', 'str')])}
# first element of the shapefile
c.next()
{'geometry': {'type': 'LineString', 'coordinates': [(272830.63, 155125.73000000001), (273770.32000000001, 155467.75)]}, 'type': 'Feature', 'id': '0', 'properties': OrderedDict([(u'test', 145), (u'string', u'hello')])}



Conclusion


If you don't want to modify the shapefile, it is easier with schema.copy() that is only used to get a copy of the original schema (no definition here)

with fiona.open('myshp.shp', 'r') as input:
    schema = input.schema.copy()
     with fiona.open('myshp_copy2.shp', 'w', 'ESRI Shapefile', schema) as output:
         for elem in input:
             output.write({'properties': elem['properties'],'geometry': mapping(shape(elem['geometry']))})

8603,Twisted pair cable twists and unwanted signals issue,"I am confused about one point I have read the following paragraph from the networking book.
“the twists in the twisted pair cable are used to avoid the unwanted signals. For example one twist, one wire is closer to the noise source and the other is farther; in the next twist the reverse is true. Twisting makes its probable that both wires are equally affected by the unwanted signal. This means that the receiver which calculate the difference between the two receives no unwanted signal.”

Now ok I understood the purpose of twists but I am confused about how receiver will calculate the difference when it will receive the signal?. How unwanted signal will be eliminated ? 
Another thing that I want to make clear is ,  I am beginner please provide such an answer that can be understood.
",Zia ur Rahman,https://serverfault.com/users/44270,"Wikipedia has a good article on twisted pair (excerpt below):


  In balanced pair operation, the two
  wires carry equal and opposite signals
  and the destination detects the
  difference between the two. This is
  known as differential mode
  transmission. Noise sources introduce
  signals into the wires by coupling of
  electric or magnetic fields and tend
  to couple to both wires equally. The
  noise thus produces a common-mode
  signal which is cancelled at the
  receiver when the difference signal is
  taken. This method starts to fail when
  the noise source is close to the
  signal wires; the closer wire will
  couple with the noise more strongly
  and the common-mode rejection of the
  receiver will fail to eliminate it.
  This problem is especially apparent in
  telecommunication cables where pairs
  in the same cable lie next to each
  other for many miles. One pair can
  induce crosstalk in another and it is
  additive along the length of the
  cable. Twisting the pairs counters
  this effect as on each half twist the
  wire nearest to the noise-source is
  exchanged. Providing the interfering
  source remains uniform, or nearly so,
  over the distance of a single twist,
  the induced noise will remain
  common-mode. Differential signaling
  also reduces electromagnetic radiation
  from the cable, along with the
  associated attenuation allowing for
  greater distance between exchanges.

6966,How does owning a home and paying on a mortgage fit into family savings and investment?,"I'm in my mid-20's, and so I am aiming at long-term growth with higher risk in my portfolio.  My financial adviser is showing me some investment allocations that put my money in some growth, mid, and value-retention locations.  He doesn't seem to be taking into the equation the fact that I am putting a huge percentage of my paycheck into my home.

I know home values fluctuate, but long term, it seems to be a pretty good way to at least retain value, and at best make a small return.  If I am already contributing so much to my ""home"" investment, why would I also invest in stocks or bonds with a low rate of return, even though they are considered a ""safe"" part of my portfolio?

Update: I think the question really has two parts.

1) How does owning a home fit into my financial portfolio?  Most seem to agree that at best it is a hedge against rent or dollar inflation, and at worst it should be viewed as a liability, and has no place alongside other real investments.

2) How should one view payments on a home mortgage?  How are they similar or different to investing in low-risk low-reward investments?

  1) How does owning a home fit into my financial portfolio? Most seem to agree that at best it is a hedge against rent or dollar inflation, and at worst it should be viewed as a liability, and has no place alongside other real investments.


Periods of high inflation are generally accompanied with high(er) interest rates. Any home is a liability, as has been pointed out in other answers; it costs money to live in, it costs money to keep in good shape, and it offers you no return unless you sell it for more than you have paid for it in total (in fact, as long as you have an outstanding mortgage, it actually costs you money to own, even when not considering things like property taxes, utilities etc.).

The only way to make a home an investment is to rent it out for more than it costs you in total to own, but then you can't live in it instead.


  2) How should one view payments on a home mortgage? How are they similar or different to investing in low-risk low-reward investments?


Like JoeTaxpayer said in a comment, paying off your mortgage should be considered the same as putting money into a certificate of deposit with a term and return equivalent to your mortgage interest cost (adjusting for tax effects). What is important to remember about paying off a mortgage, besides the simple and not so unimportant fact that it lowers your financial risk over time, is that over time it improves your cash flow.

If interest rates don't change (unlikely), then as long as you keep paying the interest vigilantly but don't pay down the principal (assuming that the bank is happy with such an arrangement), your monthly cost remains the same and will do so in perpetuity. You currently have a cash flow that enables you to pay down the principal on the loan, and are putting some fairly significant amount of money towards that end. Now, suppose that you were to lose your job, which means a significant cut in the household income. If this cut means that you can't afford paying down the mortgage at the same rate as before, you can always call the bank and tell them to stop the extra payments until you get your ducks back in the proverbial row. It's also possible, with a long history of paying on time and a loan significantly smaller than what the house would bring in in a sale, that you could renegotiate the loan with an extended term, which depending on the exact terms may lower your monthly cost further. If the size of the loan is largely the same as or perhaps even exceeds the market value of the house, the bank would be a lot more unlikely to cooperate in such a scenario.

It's also a good idea to at the very least aim to be free of debt by the time you retire. Even if one assumes that the pension systems will be the same by then as they are now (some don't, but that's a completely different question), you are likely to see a significant cut in cash flow on retirement day. Any fixed expenses which cannot easily be cut if needed are going to become a lot more of a liability when you are actually at least in part living off your savings rather than contributing to them.

The earlier you get the mortgage paid off, the earlier you will have the freedom to put into other forms of savings the money which is now going not just to principal but to interest as well. What is important to consider is that paying off a mortgage is a very illiquid form of savings; on the other hand, money in stocks, bonds, various mutual funds, and savings accounts, tends to be highly liquid. It is always a good idea to have some savings in easily accessible form, some of it in very low-risk investments such as a simple interest-bearing savings account or government bonds (despite their low rate of return) before you start to aggressively pay down loans, because (particularly when you own a home) you never know when something might come up that ends up costing a fair chunk of money.

",Questioner,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/47553,"You can't and you absolutely SHOULD NOT!

The main feature of X509 certificate signature in SSL/TLS is that a third party guarantees that you're actually connecting to a system that has been approved by the owner of a domain name (it is the assumption that you already know the relation between the domain name and the actual entity you're trying to interact with).

Issuing a certificate for a name that isn't uniquely linked to an entity does not allow that validation to take place: such a signed certificate wouldn't carry any guarantee.

The bright point, however, is that if the only way you're using SSL is to validate the server identity, then it simply it doesn't matter if the certificate is signed by a trusted CA: you should be using certificate pinning in any case (not that it matters much, mind you, since you can assume that if someone can hijack your service listening on the loopback address, he can also grab the private key associated with the certificate).

  An ice golem's body generates intense cold, dealing 1d6 points of damage with its touch.

If so, would this be on the Golem's turn, on the target's turn, or on both turns?
",Nyoze,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/23186,"Rules as Written

It may seem that way, but the ability further clarifies how it works:

Cold (Ex)


  An ice golem's body generates intense cold, dealing 1d6 points of
  damage with its touch. Creatures attacking an ice golem with unarmed
  strikes or natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of
  their attacks hits.


So two things happen because of this ability:


The golem slam attacks deal an additional 1d6 cold damage, that can be seen on his stat block: 


  Melee 2 slams +9 (1d6+3 plus 1d6 cold)

And the ability specifies that anyone attacking the golem with unarmed or natural attacks will take 1d6 cold damage. If it also worked against grapple attempts with barehands, it should specify so.


If a simple touch would also cause that damage, the ability would make that clear, because it would also affect casters trying to deliver touch spells.
As written, all rules must be clear how an ability should work or not, anything that isn't clear is left for each GM to decide, which brings us to...

Rules as Intended

Though the ability's wording is clear that simply touching it shouldnt cause the extra damage to you, that is clearly not how it is intended to work. But i simply believe nobody asked themselves What would happen if someone tried to grapple this guy? during the development process.

A fine example of that are Fire Elementals and their Burn ability. What should happen when you hug a big ball of flames? You should hurt yourself in the process, and most likely catch on fire.

Personally, this is how i would rule it on my table.


  If a Golem were to initiate a grapple, would this ability trigger
  dealing damage to grappled target?


Now, if a fire elemental or ice golem initiated a grapple, RaW it wouldnt deal an extra damage, because you can attack the grappled target with a unarmed, natural weapon or light/1handed weapon, that should deal the ice damage.
But RaI, it would be really nasty to get your arm/leg freeze while being punched in the face by ice blocks. Golems hardly would initiate a grapple due to their intelligence score, but i could see a fire elemental doing so to bring a burning death to their foes.


  If so, would this be on the Golem's turn, on the target's turn, or on
  both turns?


On the golem's turn if he initiated the grapple, on the grappler's turn if the golem is grappled.

3284,Is Stormguard Warrior really that good?,"I have an idea of build centered around the Crusader class, with some possible dips in Warblade/Swordsage to take advantage of the goodies in other disciplines (such as Ironheart Surge or Time Stands Still).

The dip in the Warblade class brings me the opportunity to take the Stormguard Warrior tactical feat, and I have seen it recommended a number of times specifically for its Channel the Storm option (ToB, p.36):


  Channel the Storm: To use this option, you must choose to refrain from making one or more available attacks of opportunity against a single opponent. On your next turn, you gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for each attack that you refrained from making against the same opponent. You gain this bonus only against an opponent that you refrained from making an attack of opportunity against in the previous round.


I am wondering if this feat is really that good. It seems that it requires a huge investment (in terms of feats) and it is unclear to me whether it really pays off.

The bonuses +4 AR/dmg per refrained AoO (which you have an infinite supply of (*)) do seem interesting, at first, however:


A prerequisite of Stormguard Warrior is Ironheart Aura, which in itself does not seem that interesting, especially for a Crusader (Thicket of Blade is not an Ironheart stance)
The bonuses gained can only be used against the opponent that generated them, and no other (it's a minor restriction, but worth keeping in mind)
An AoO is likely to do much more damage than 4, especially if using a two-handed weapon (even at level 1, we are looking at 1d10 + 6 ~= 11.5)


Thus, the two feats investment seems only worth it if one can generate more AoOs than one has available. In the recommendations I have seen, it is combined with Robilar's Gambit (-4 AR, 1 AoO per foe attack in melee) which itself requires Combat Reflexes. Dexterity is unlikely to be ignored (since it benefits Touch AC), and therefore we are looking at a minimum of 3 or 4 available AoOs per round...

Letting Combat Reflexes and Robilar's Gambit aside, is it really worth it investing in Ironheart Aura and Stormguard Warrior? Am I missing something?

(*) I have seen some debates where it is argued that refraining to take an AoO to fuel up Channel the Storm should use it up, which I ignore here. The feat is much worse in this case.
",Matthieu M.,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/1355,"Stormguard Warrior is an excellent feat – for building a character around

Stormguard Warrior can add huge amounts of attack and damage bonuses, but it requires that you be pretty dedicated towards generating attacks of opportunity to not take. Specifically, the feats Karmic StrikeCWar and Robilar’s GambitPHB2 are often used, because these feats allow you to take many more attacks of opportunity than you could otherwise (Karmic Strike allows you an AoO every time you’re hit, while Robilar’s Gambit allows you an AoO every time you’re attacked, whether they hit or not). Other ways of getting attacks of opportunity (defensive rebuke Devoted Spirit boostToB) or prevents others from avoiding them (thicket of blades stanceToB as mentioned, Mage Slayer featCArc) are also useful, but don’t add nearly as much as Karmic and/or Robilar’s.

But Ironheart Aura is pretty much a dead feat, yes, and without Karmic or Robilar’s, you’ll rarely see more than +4/+4 from Stormguard Warrior. +4/+4 for two feats isn’t entirely awful, of course; the Weapon Focus/Specialization line (which are awful) is four feats for +2/+4. If you have reach and thicket of blades, the +4/+4 seems pretty likely; using defensive rebuke can improve that dramatically. And it is pretty much expected that you’re using Power Attack with a big two-hander, so it’s really +0/+12. Basically, you’re trading extra attacks (attacks of opportunity) for more potent attacks in general (skip one AoO, get a full attack with +12 on each attack). So it’s not a terrible use of feats. Just not the highly-recommended one that it would be with Karmic and/or Robilar’s.

Also, note the Combat Rhythm option on Stormguard Warrior; it’s not nearly as explosive as Channel the Storm, but it is cool. Personally, I have always wanted to have that opportunity to combine it with avalanche of blades for hilarity. That’s not really an option for a crusader with a warblade dip, though.

The other thing to point out about Stormguard Warrior is that the Evasive Reflexes featToB uses the same “don’t take an AoO you could have, get something instead” mechanic, and like Stormguard Warrior, it doesn’t use up the AoO. You can use both Evasive Reflexes and Stormguard Warrior. This is particularly useful when you have thicket of blades – their 5-ft. steps provoke an AoO from you, which lets you 5-ft. step to keep up with them and gives you +4/+4. If that step was to try to get away from you so they could do something that provokes (say, cast a spell while you have Mage Slayer, or attack an ally after you hit them with defensive rebuke), you have either just prevented them from doing that, or are going to get pumped up even more.

1853,Why do the Borg have physical computer interfaces?,"I was watching Scorpion (VOY) parts 1 and 2 last night and a thought struck me: sure, their computer interface looks pretty cool, but why do they have a physical interface (i.e. they tap the screen physically) in the first place?  It's made quite clear that they can interface with each other through mental transceivers and they make a big deal about thoughts being a more efficient communication method than verbal communication in Scorpion Part 2 with Tuvok and Janeway.  Therefore, wouldn't a mental interface with a computer be more efficient?  Surely, then, they could have the drones in their stations for most of the time, just thinking to interact with the computer rather than having to tap their way through an interface.  Is there any reason given for this?

And, although I only recall seeing 7 of 9 using the computer via physical interaction in Scorpion, there are plenty of instances in other episodes where other drones also use physical interaction with the computer.

Any ideas how this can be done on a ASA? There was a sonicwall in place but it just died and we do not have a replacement besides this ASA. The 24.172.x.132 is a spam filter and I can't change the IP address. It needs to be able to access one server in the LAN.
",evolvd,https://serverfault.com/users/32265,"A traditional DMZ would have a firewall between the DMZ and the internet, and one between the DMZ and the inside network.  You can do this all on an ASA, but it depends on the model and licensing.

Internet
--------- Firewall
DMZ (with your spam filter)
--------- Firewall
Inside network


You could make that first firewall a software one, running on the spam-filter server.

So you could have the server on the Internet network as far as the ASA is concerned.  If you have spare ports on your ASA you could just assign one to the outside network (so you have two) and connect your spam server to that.  Then create a firewall rule allowing traffic from the spam-filter server into your inside network as required.  If you don't have a spare port, you will need a switch before the ASA.

You could get more fancy using a DMZ vlan on the ASA itself, and use the ASA to firewall the spam-filter, and the inside network.  This is probably the closest to what your Sonicwall was doing.

8548,numpy float: 10x slower than builtin in arithmetic operations?,"EDIT:

I rerun the code under the Windows 7 x64 (Intel Core i7 930 @ 3.8GHz).

Again, the code is:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

# one of the following lines is uncommented before execution
#s = np.float64(1)
#s = np.float32(1)
#s = 1.0

for i in range(10000000):
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The timings are:


float64: 16.1s
float32: 16.1s
float: 3.2s


Now both np floats (either 64 or 32) are 5 times slower than the built-in float. Still, a significant difference. I'm trying to figure out where it comes from.

EDIT:

Thank you for the answers, they help me understand how to deal with this problem.

But I still would like to know the precise reason (based on the source code perhaps) why the code below runs 10 times slow with float64 than with float.

EDIT:

numpy.float64 is 10 times slower than float in arithmetic calculations. It's so bad that even converting to float and back before the calculations makes the program run 3 times faster. Why? Is there anything I can do to fix it?

I want to emphasize that my timings are not due to any of the following:


the function calls
the conversion between numpy and python float
the creation of objects


I updated my code to make it clearer where the problem lies. With the new code, it would seem I see a ten-fold performance hit from using numpy data types:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

# one of the following lines is uncommented before execution
#s = np.float64(1)
#s = np.float32(1)
#s = 1.0

for i in range(10000000):
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The timings are:


float64: 34.56s
float32: 35.11s
float: 3.53s


Just for the hell of it, I also tried:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

s = np.float64(1)
for i in range(10000000):
    s = float(s)
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232
    s = np.float64(s)

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The execution time is 13.28 s; it's actually 3 times faster to convert the float64 to float and back than to use it as is. Still, the conversion takes its toll, so overall it's more than 3 times slower compared to the pure-python float.

My machine is:


Intel Core 2 Duo T9300 (2.5GHz)
WinXP Professional (32-bit)
ActiveState Python 3.1.3.5
Numpy 1.5.1


END OF EDIT

ORIGINAL QUESTION:

I am getting really weird timings for the following code:

import numpy as np
s = 0
for i in range(10000000):
    s += np.float64(1) # replace with np.float32 and built-in float



built-in float: 4.9 s
float64: 10.5 s
float32: 45.0 s


Why is float64 twice slower than float? And why is float32 5 times slower than float64?

Is there any way to avoid the penalty of using np.float64, and have numpy functions return built-in float instead of float64?

I found that using numpy.float64 is much slower than Python's float, and numpy.float32 is even slower (even though I'm on a 32-bit machine).

numpy.float32 on my 32-bit machine. Therefore, every time I use various numpy functions such as numpy.random.uniform, I convert the result to float32 (so that further operations would be performed at 32-bit precision).

Is there any way to set a single variable somewhere in the program or in the command line, and make all numpy functions return float32 instead of float64?
",max,https://stackoverflow.com/users/336527,"CPython floats are allocated in chunks

The key problem with comparing numpy scalar allocations to the float type is that CPython always allocates the memory for float and int objects in blocks of size N.

Internally, CPython maintains a linked list of blocks each large enough to hold N float objects.  When you call float(1) CPython checks if there is space available in the current block; if not it allocates a new block.  Once it has space in the current block it simply initializes that space and returns a pointer to it. 

On my machine each block can hold 41 float objects, so there is some overhead for the first float(1) call but the next 40 run much faster as the memory is allocated and ready.

Slow numpy.float32 vs. numpy.float64

It appears that numpy has 2 paths it can take when creating a scalar type: fast and slow. This depends on whether the scalar type has a Python base class to which it can defer for argument conversion.

For some reason numpy.float32 is hard-coded to take the slower path (defined by the _WORK0 macro), while numpy.float64 gets a chance to take the faster path (defined by the _WORK1 macro). Note that scalartypes.c.src is a template which generates scalartypes.c at build time.

You can visualize this in Cachegrind. I've included screen captures showing how many more calls are made to construct a float32 vs. float64:

float64 takes the fast path



float32 takes the slow path



Updated - Which type takes the slow/fast path may depend on whether the OS is 32-bit vs 64-bit. On my test system, Ubuntu Lucid 64-bit, the float64 type is 10 times faster than float32.

Sleep/Wakes since boot:31   Dark Wake Count in this sleep cycle:1


The spooky wake-up-event I was watching was at 2013-08-10 22:50:51
But the logfile shows even more activities while I was sleeping in my bed:

2013-08-11 00:01:35
2013-08-11 02:52:04
2013-08-11 04:07:32  

The next wake-up was initiated by me: 2013-08-11 04:07:32
But what are the reasons for those events in the middle of the night? Why did my iMac wake up?

EHC1 corresponds with the times when I did wake up the machine.
EC.SleepTimer are wake-ups that happened without my interaction.
What are EHC1 and EC.SleepTimer?
",Hubert Schölnast,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/25938,"Check your log messages by typing following in Terminal while looking for the time stamp for when it occurred.

syslog |grep -i ""Wake reason""


which will give you a comprehensive report only for wake up reasons.

UPDATE:

Looking at your log now, it all looks normal. 

Be aware that the only time your computer can do some housekeeping is during the sleep time. That is intended by design. 

However, to prevent unwanted wake ups disable the wake for wifi network access.

7837,Combined ADC scaling and offset with variable input voltage ranges,"I am trying to create a circuit which will allow me to scale and offset a voltage (be it AC or DC) to within the range of the Arduino ADC.

The voltage could be anything between + and - 250V, but I also need to have good sensitivity over lower voltage ranges too.

To this end I am looking at a circuit whereby you can vary the voltage range that it expects the input to be and amplify/attenuate it accordingly.  How I will be making the decision and setting the different gains is for another topic for now.  I am only interested in the scaling and offsetting at the moment.

So far I have come up with this circuit:



Which appears to do just what I want for the +/- 250V range.  I don't know how ""safe"" this circuit is, and if I am endangering any of the components with the 250V or not.  The graphs at the bottom are (left to right) the input voltage, the power consumption of the bottom 10M resistor, the voltage across the 100M resistor (which is simulating the Arduino ADC input) and the power consumption of the upper 10M resistor.

Now, if I drop the input voltage to just +/- 2.5V and tweak the op-amp feedback resistor accordingly, for some reason the offset voltage the op-amp is adding jumps right up.  I don't know for sure if this is the fault of the simulator I am using, or if it is really what will happen, as I haven't yet breadboarded this circuit (I guess that's the next stage).

This is the output from the 2.5V version:



You can see how the offset has jumped up and the output is clipping massively.

If I drop the lower 10K resistor to the virtual ground offset voltage divider to just 3.3K it compensates, but that's not nice - I would like to just vary the one resistor.  

The op-amp is (will be) a 5V single supply rail-to-rail I/O one.

The two diodes are to protect the input of the op-amp against over voltage - I don't know if this circuit strictly needs them, but I guess it doesn't hurt to have them there.

Also, I don't know if the resistor values are quite what I want - I chose them to keep the power consumption right down and the impedance right up.  I don't want them to impact the frequency response of the circuit more than I can help - the input waveform could be anything from DC up to around 500KHz or so, and I need that reproducing at the ADC end as faithfully as I can.  (I know the Arduino can only really sample at lower speeds than that, but the Arduino is just for experimenting - the final system will use a dsPIC with 1.1Msps ADC).

So, what can I do to A) get a more stable offset, B) allow the varying of the input sensitivity without nuking either the op-amp or the ADC, and C) make the circuit safe to connect to, for example, a European mains voltage?
",Majenko,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/4245,"Several comments:

Add component designators to your schematic.  It is difficult to talk about the circuit otherwise.

You appear to be a little confused about resistor dividers.  You have two resistor on the input, but only one is doing anything.  The resistor to ground is just a load on the input but otherwise has no bearing on your circuit.  It sortof looks like the two input resistors (component designators would definitely help) are meant to be a divider that didn't get hooked up right.

Yes, you can use opamps for gains below 1, but you might as well use resistor dividers instead.  Also keep in mind that at best opamps are specified as stable for unity gain magnitude, but not below.  You would have to add your own compensation for that.

Three resistors, one from the input voltage, one to ground, and one to the supply can be adjusted such that the input voltage range maps reasonably well to the 0-5V A/D range without any active parts.  You can then use the opamp as a voltage buffer because the output of the resistor divider may not have low enough impedance.

Instead of changing gains, I would just have a few different gain setups driving different A/D pins.  As long as the voltages are properly clipped, they won't hurt being out of range.  The full 220V signal may be out of range for the high sensitivity A/D input, so you ignore that and only use the low sensitivity reading.  When the signal level is low, the high sensitivity input won't be clipped, so you can use that.  Nothing needs to change except in the firmware, which decides which input to use for the particular magnitude of input signal.

500 kHz is a lot for the high value resistors you show.  Those should work at 50 Hz, but at 1000 times higher frequency the parasitic capacitance will be significant compared to those resistances.



Added:

If whatever software you are using doesn't allow for component designators, use something that does.  At least use that when drawing the schematic for other people to see.  Simulators are overrated anyway.  They have their uses, but all too often they seem to make the user forget he has a brain of his own.  For a trivial circuit like yours, it would take longer to enter it into a simulator than to simply think it out.

You can do a lot with a three-resistor divider as I mentioned above:



This can't always exactly fill the 0-Vdd output range with the input signal.  But even when it can't, there is usually a good enough solution.  Generally the more you need to attenuate, the easier it is to get the output into the desired range.

To analyze this circuit, note that by themselves R2 and R3 form a voltage divider of Vdd.  This can be thought of as a voltage between Vdd and ground with a specific impedance (see Thevanin):



Where R4 = R2 // R3.  How you can see we have a simple two-resistor voltage divider.  The divider gain is R4/(R1+R4) and the output impedance is R1//R4.  From 7th grade math we know that whatever this circuit does to the input voltage can be described by:

Vout = Vin(M) + B

You can find M and B easily enough from the above equation from any two different points.  In your case, Vdd = 5V, so you want the output to be symmetric around half that, or 2.5V.  So at Vin=0 you want Vout=2.5.  Two other obvious known points are the peaks of the input waveform.  Let's pick the negative one, so at Vin=-250 Vout=0.  Now M and B can be easily solved.

If you want to find a exact solution, you can write the equations for M and B in terms of R1, R4, and V1.  As long as V1 is more than 0 and less than Vdd, a exact solution is possible.  From the simplified second schematic, it should be obvious that:

M = R4/(R1 + R4)
  B = V1 * R1 / (R1 + R4)

Note that this system is underconstrained as there are 3 unknowns and only 2 equations.  The extra degree of freedom can be expressed as the final output impedance of Vout, which is R1//R4.

You have enough here to write all the equations and solve them.  That's no longer electronics but grade school arithmetic, so that's your job.  Instead I'll take a less exact but more intuitive hack at it here.

Let's say you want the output impedance to not exceed 10 k&Omega;.  We know the attenuation will be high, so R1 will be significantly larger than R4.  For simplicity, let's simply make R4 = 10 k&Omega;.  That will make the output impedance a little less than 10 k&Omega;.  You have a 500V input range and want a 5V output range, so the divider gain should be 1/100.  Again to make things simple, we'll just make R1 = 100*R4 = 1M&Omega;.  That actually results in a gain of 1/101, but a little margin is a good idea and you'd have to get 1% resistors as it is to guarantee the gain isn't more than 1/100.  So far we have:

R1 = 1 M&Omega;
  R4 = 10 k&Omega;

At this high attenuation ratio, B pretty much equals V1, so let's just make V1 = 2.5V.  Now we still need to get R2 and R3 from R4.  From the values above, each should be 20 k&Omega;.  However, we're making some approximations and it's good to allow for a little slop anyway, so I'd start with the next lower common value of 18 k&Omega;.

Now you need to plug all that in and compute the output voltage at the peaks of the input voltage, taking into account inaccuracies in the resistors.  I'll leave that as a exercise to you, but the values above are either good enough or pretty close for a starting point.

Folks,
Photoshop newbie here with what I think is a simple question, but clearly, I am not searching for the right keywords on Google.

I have a hand-sketched pattern that I have scanned into a (bitmap) image. It is a crisp black and white image. I would like for a way to get Photoshop (or Illustrator) to detect the edges and extract paths from it, thereby converting it into a vector graphic.

Is there a simple way to accomplish this?

Thanks.

516,Correlating /var/log/* timestamps,"/var/log/messages, /var/log/syslog, and some other log files use a timestamp which contains an absolute time, like Jan 13 14:13:10.

/var/log/Xorg.0.log and /var/log/dmesg, as well as the output of $ dmesg, use a format that looks like

[50595.991610] malkovich: malkovich malkovich malkovich malkovich


I'm guessing/gathering that the numbers represent seconds and microseconds since startup.

However, my attempt to correlate these two sets of timestamps (using the output from uptime) gave a discrepancy of about 5000 seconds.

This is roughly the amount of time my computer was suspended for.

Is there a convenient way to map the numeric timestamps used by dmesg and Xorg into absolute timestamps?

update

As a preliminary step towards getting this figured out, and also to hopefully make my question a bit more clear, I've written a Python script to parse /var/log/syslog and output the time skew.  On my machine, running ubuntu 10.10, that file contains numerous kernel-originated lines which are stamped both with the dmesg timestamp and the syslog timestamp.  The script outputs a line for each line in that file which contains a kernel timestamp.

Usage:

python syslogdriver.py /var/log/syslog | column -nts $'\t'

... The final lines are from a bit further down, still well above the end of the output.  Some of them presumably got written to dmesg's circular buffer before the suspend happened, and were only propagated to syslog afterwards.  This explains why all of them have the same syslog timestamp.

Column definitions:

abs is the time logged by syslog.

abs_since_boot is that same time in seconds since system startup, based on the contents of /proc/uptime and the value of time.time().

rel_time is the kernel timestamp.

rel_offset is the difference between abs_since_boot and rel_time.  I'm rounding this to the tens of seconds so as to avoid one-off errors due to the absolute (i.e. syslog-generated) timestamps only having seconds precision.  That's actually not the right way to do it, since it really (I think..) just results in a smaller chance of having an off-by-10 error.  If somebody has a better idea, please let me know.

I also have some questions about syslog's date format; in particular, I'm wondering if a year ever shows up in it.  I'm guessing no, and in any case could most likely help myself to that information in TFM, but if somebody happens to know it would be useful.  ..Assuming, of course, that someone uses this script at some point in the future, instead of just busting out a couple of lines of Perl code.

Next:

So unless some welcome revelation is unto me given by one of You, my next step will be to add a function to get the time skew for a given kernel timestamp.  I should be able to feed the script one or a set of syslogs, along with a kernel timestamp, to get an absolute timestamp.  Then I can get back to debugging my Xorg issues, which escape me at the moment.

7980,"Solve for time, given distance and acceleration","Two gangsters are flying down I-70 West at a constant 108 hm/hr. If they make it to Indiana, they will be safe. When they are 1 km away from the Indiana border, while still traveling at a constant 108 km/hr, they pass a concealed police car hidden in a speed trap. At the instant that the criminals pass the patrol car, the cop pulls onto the highway and accelerates at a constant rate of 2 m/s^2. Does the cop catch up with them before they cross the state line?

Here's what I have progressed so far


  ΔV = (ΔX)/(T)
  
  when V is velocity, X is distance, and T is time.
  
  108 = (1 - 0)/T
  
  108T = 1
  
  T = 1/108
  
  T = 0.00925 hours
  
  T = 0.00925 * 60 * 60
  
  T = 33.33 seconds (this is the time it takes the gangsters to get to
  the borders of Indiana)


What I am stuck at is the time it takes the cop to travel the same distance. I have used the distance formula to find time as follows:


  Xf = Xi + 1/2 * A * T^2
  
  where A is acceleration
  
  Since the cop is starting from rest, the initial velocity is 0 (zero),
  so
  
  1 = 0 + 1/2 * (2) * T^2
  
  1 = T^2
  
  T = 1 seconds


So it takes the cop 1 seconds to travel the whole mile to Indiana? What am I doing wrong?

4965,Shape of rotating rope (lasso problem?),"Let's take a wire or a rope. I usually do this with a chain or my scarf.

I fixate one end in my hand and apply rotation (by subtle movements of this endpoint like spinning a lasso). The rope gets into rotation and obtains certain bent shape:


Some part is missing because cellphone cameras ain't great for high-speed photos but I hope you can imagine all the scarf.

The question is: how can I calculate/predict this shape?

Although this problem doesn't seem that bizarre, I have never seen any solution. Nor I have found this question asked anywhere on internet... Must be because I just don't know how to formulate it without pictures.

Also by taking longer rope I get more than one bend:


I apoligize for the quality again. It is even harder to rotate this while taking picture. The form is not spiral, it is more like a shape in a plane that's rotating.

I'll be thankful for explanations, solutions, links or at least a correct formulation of this problem.
",Džuris,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/12727,"It's an interesting problem. I've tried to study it neglecting the air friction, which is likely to be nonnegligible. So let's parametrize the rope of length $L$ by the vector $(z(l), r(l))$, with $l$ being the curviligne coordinate along the rope and $(z,r)$ the cylindrical coordinates of the rope (I've omitted $\theta$, which can be assumed to be constant in the rotating frame [see my comment below this post for a justification of this omission]). 
In the rotating frame, the potential energy of the rope is
$$E_p=\int_0^L \mu dl\left(gz-\frac12\Omega^2r^2\right)$$
and the definition of the curviligne integral gives the constraint $r&#39;^2+l&#39;^2=1$. So the problem can be translated into minimizing the following quantity :
$$\begin{align}
 \int_0^Ldl \mathcal L(z,r;z&#39;,r&#39;;l) &amp; &amp;
 \text{with } \mathcal L(z,r;z&#39;,r&#39;;l)=\mu gz - \tfrac12\mu\Omega^2r^2 - \lambda(z&#39;^2+r&#39;^2).
\end{align}$$
One should not forget (as I did in a first tentative answer) that the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ depends on $l$/
It is a standard Euler-Lagrange problem and its solution is given by
$$\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial z}-\frac{d}{dl}\frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial z}&amp;=0&amp;
&amp;\text{and}&amp;
 \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial r}-\frac{d}{dl}\frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial r}&amp;=0&amp;
\end{align}$$
The equation in $z$ becomes
$$\begin{align}
\mu g&amp;=-2\frac{d}{dl}(\lambda z&#39;)&amp;
\lambda z&#39;&amp;= -\tfrac12 \mu g(l-l_0),
\end{align}$$
where $l_0$ is an integration constant. For the optimal solution $z&#39;\le 0$, since replacing $z&#39; by -|z&#39;|$ can only decrease $\mathcal L$, ans we have $z&#39;=-\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}$. One has therefore
$$\lambda=\frac{\mu g(l-l_0)}{2\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}}$$.
The equation in $r$ is then
$$-\mu\Omega^2r=-2\frac{d}{dl}(\lambda r&#39;) =-\frac{d}{dl}\frac{\mu g(l-l_0)r&#39;}{\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}}$$
We have then the following equation to integrate
$$0=\frac{\Omega^2}{g}r(1-r&#39;^2)^{3/2}-r&#39;(1-r&#39;^2)-(l-l_0)r&#39;&#39;.$$
I don't know how to integrate it analytically, but when $l-l_0&lt;0$, it seems that we can have oscillations.

Edited to add :

If one looks at the signs of $r&#39;$ and $r&#39;&#39;$ as function of $r$ and $r&#39;$ for a fixed $l$, one can quickly draw some arrows in phase space (i.e.) and see that the flow goes ""in circles"" when $l&lt;l_0$ and tends asymptotically to the curve $\frac{\Omega^2}{g}r=\frac{r&#39;}{\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}}$ when $l&gt;l0$. So one can expect a finite number of oscillations of the rope. But the whole question is then how $l_0$ relates to the parameters of the system.

Edit: In the limit of almost vertical rope ($r'\ll1$), the equation becomes
$$0=\frac{\Omega^2}{g}r-r&#39;-(l-l_0)r&#39;&#39;$$
which is simpler. And indeed, Wolfram Alpha has an analytical solution using modified Bessel functions.

How things should really work

There's a famous concept in programming called MVC, which stands for Model-View-Controller. The controller is irrelevant now, so I'll omit it, only discussing model and views:



There's always one model which represents the data or what needs to be persisted (stored). Then there are views - what the user see. Sometimes a user sees two views of the same data (think of a list of bars next to pins on a map), sometimes many users see each a view of the same model.

We assume that a user can edit the view, and the role of the MVC framework is ensure that once 1 view is updated all other views update as well.

With websites, there are quite a lot of layers between the model (which is stored and served by the server) and the view (which the user sees on their client browser), so it took us quite a few decades that get this update mechanism working on the web.

Early internet technology was based on the pull model - users had to perform an action, which would send a request to the server that holds the data and the server would respond with the data. So to get updates, users had to press or do something.

Nowadays, the need for a push model (the server pushes data the the clients, without them asking for it) is in high demand, and modern web technologies accommodate such need. One example is you may be looking at a question on this site, and suddenly get a notification that someone left a comment to one of your answers to another question - the notification just shows, even if you were just looking.

My point is, that with correct implementation using modern technology, whenever item X has changed, anyone watching it should be notified. One common problem in UX is that people got so used to dated technology that they take bad usability and how things work (or how things don't work) as a norm.

Should you show it to the users.

I honestly can't think of a single argument why not.

The most obvious reason to show it to users is that status of the system should be obvious to users. If something changes, and it doesn't reflect on the screen somehow, than the system status is no longer communicated to the user correctly.

Just consider someone spending 10 minutes to edit a form, only to get a message it was already deleted by the time they finish. It's a bit like the following phone conversation at the top of this post.

To summarise - you should always let the user know that the version they are looking at is no longer up-to-date. How you handle the various scenario (edited or deleted, for example) has to do with the business logic and the system in question.

To give one example, it happens sometimes that whilst you answer a question on this site, the original or the moderators delete it. Immediately you get a notification saying ""This post has been delete, no answers will be accepted"" and the ""Answer"" button becomes disabled. As no one has an idea what you'd like to do next, they keep you on the screen, but you can't do much on it other than going elsewhere.

Not all systems work that way. In many systems deleting an entity doesn't actually deletes it - it simply marks it as deleted and doesn't show anywhere; this open doors to alternative handling option.

1785,Euclid's Algorithm (Greatest Common Divisor),"According to Donald Knuth in ""The Art Of Computer Programming"", the following is how to find the greatest common divisor of two positive numbers, m and n, using Euclid's Algorithm.


  
  Divide m by n and let r be the remainder.
  If r is 0, n is the answer; if r is not 0, continue to step 3.
  Set m = n and n = r. Go back to step 1.
  


Below is my implementation of this algorithm.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int greatestCommonDivisor(int m, int n)
{
    int r;

    /* Check For Proper Input */
    if((m == 0) || (n == 0))
        return 0;
    else if((m &lt; 0) || (n &lt; 0))
        return -1;

    do
    {
        r = m % n;
        if(r == 0)
            break;
        m = n;
        n = r;
    }
    while(true);

    return n;
}

int main(void)
{
    int num1 = 600, num2 = 120;
    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(num1, num2); 

    printf(""The GCD of %d and %d is %d\n"", num1, num2, gcd);

    getchar();
    return 0;
}


Though it appears to work just fine, it doesn't seem to be as elegant as I'd like, especially in the do-while loop.  Also, the while(true) seems dangerous, though I'm pretty confident that r will be reduced to 0 eventually and we'll break out of the loop.

Do you have any suggestions on either making the code more elegant or robust?
",Fiddling Bits,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/33159,"Firstly, your implementation is (arguably) not quite correct:

 else if((m &lt; 0) || (n &lt; 0))
     return -1;


The GCD of two negative numbers is perfectly well defined. However, if you really don't want the user to pass in negative numbers, make it explicit in the function signature:

unsigned greatestCommonDivisor(unsigned m, unsigned n)


Euclid's algorithm is one of the most basic examples of where recursion shines:

unsigned greatestCommonDivisor(unsigned m, unsigned n)
{
    if(n == 0) return m;
    return greatestCommonDivisor(n, m % n);
}


We first check the base case, which is 2: If r is 0, n is the answer; if r is not 0, continue to step 3. The recursive call actually combines steps 1 and 3 here: m % n sets n to be the remainder r, and we call the function again with n = m.

As a final note, a lot of people avoid recursive functions in C/C++ because most compilers don't optimise tail-calls to use constant stack space. However, Euclid's algorithm will perform only O(log N) steps, hence it's easy to see on any computer with (reasonable) stack size, this won't cause a stack overflow for numbers whose size is constrained by int or unsigned.

However, the numerical value for $c$ depends on the units used. When working in units in which the speed of light $c=1$, one would conclude that both fields are equal in magnitude. 

A better way to look at this is to consider the energy carried by an electromagnetic wave. It turns out that the energy associated with the electric field is equal to the energy associated with the magnetic field. So in terms of energies electric and magnetic fields are equals.

4542,"iPhone dock connector problems, with and without accessories","I started to experience problems with my iPhone that seem to be related to the dock connector.

Upon plugging my iPhone into my (officially supported) car stereo, I started to get the message  ""This accessory is not supported by iPhone"" on the screen.  Didn't think much of it as I only use it for charging purposes, and that still worked so I ignored it.  Then I bought a small ANT+ dongle, which is a little accessory you plug into the dock connector to allow your phone to receive data from various health/fitness devices like heart rate monitor, and cycle sensors etc.  It produces the same error message every time I plug it in, and the apps that use the dongle will not recognise it.

The dongle does officially support my hardware and OS level. I've checked that it is not broken by plugging it into an iPhone 5, an iPad 3 and an iPod of some description, none of which showed the error.  The supported apps find the device on the iPad, the iPhone 5 does not have the apps installed but offers to do so as soon as I plug it in, so I know the dongle is working correctly.

In addition to the above, when nothing is plugged into the dock connector, it still occassionally thinks that something is, resulting in a muted phone.  When it's in this state I am not able to hear anything or change any volume settings (music playback or ringer volume) with the physical keys. Going into the Music app shows that it thinks it's outputting the music to the dock connector.

Why is this accessory not working on my iPhone, and how can I get it working?  What causes my iPhone to think that it's docked when it isn't?
",stuffe,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/9495,"@stuffe came up with a couple of correct solutions based on traditional wisdom, but failed to realize the depth to which Apple will go to obfuscate problems from the user.  It appears that there is a software setpoint for current (or power since the voltage is supposed to be the fixed) below which this state is triggered.

The message: ""This accessory may not be supported"", is due to insufficient power.

I am sure there is/was an Apple engineer could tell you exactly what current threshold triggers it (probable reasoning is adverse affect on battery life), but that is really irrelevant. Here are some things that you can do to correct it.


Clean connections.  Crud on connectors act as an insulator, reducing
the amount of current flow.
If its a usb cable, plug it in to something with a higher current (amps/milliamps) or power (watts/milliwatts) rating.*
Turn off, power saving features that may reduce power to usb ports. (if it stops after X minutes this is probably the reason)
Make sure your usb adapter outputs sufficient Volts (indicated by it only charging to XX% before you get the message)
Use a usb port closer to your laptop's the power supply (They often
handle more current than easier to access ones)
If you have one, you can try a powered usb hub (good ones are better
with high powered devices)
If none of that works, try a known working cable from a someone.
If that doesn't work you may have an issue with the connector in the
phone itself.


Usb power adapters should have the design voltage and current printed on them; however, this is the ""design"" rating.  Not all of them actually perform to spec in real life and it is not uncommon for components to weaken or fail over time, but still have some output.



Footnote:

I have an ASUS laptop running Linux and it has an easy to access usb port on the right  hand side near the front that doesn't output quite enough power.  Combined with a bit of connector corrosion, the only way it would charge was if I held it down fairly tightly on the charging base.  As soon as I would let go, I would get ""This accessory may not be supported"".  Simply switching it to the usb port near my power connector (in a less convenient location) was sufficient.  This tells me that it likely has nothing to do with any ""device"" specifics and since I have no iApps installed, those are ruled out too.  The only difference is the power output.  I will probably eventually need to clean my connections, but for now I'm good.

TODO: Write a polite letter to Apple requesting error messages that actually mean something.... It's probably in errno.h and strerror.h depending on how far they have gotten from their BSD roots (just add something like ELOWPWR and ""This accessory has insufficient power for charging."" respectively).

TODO: Get a cheap charger from the Dollar Tree, expose the wire and use a potentiometer and ammeter to determine an approximate current threshold that triggers the message inoperable charging state.

",Doug T.,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/321,"First, I really like Eric's answer for practical reasons.  But there is another side to screw head diversity:  Security.

In the end, it's usually a temporary measure.  Once a company invents a new screw, some third party will start selling tools to remove them.  But for a time, any new screw design means the only people who can open your parts are ""certified"" workshops you've given tools to.  Personally I see this a lot in electronic equipment, where the original manufacturer wants some aspect of design kept private or doesn't want after-market mods made to things they sell.  Nintendo is particularly active in inventing new screws.

Examples of security screws include 3-prong Torx variants, and Allen heads with a raised dot in the middle of the screw head to stop standard Allen wrenches from fitting.

If you'd like to see a much more industrial version, find a car which has been booted and look at the bolt.  I've seen circular bolt heads with an off-center circular hollow inside.  No shoulders or slots to grab, you have to have a very specific wrench.  And, of course, there are security lug nuts for car tires.

You can further boost this by using some of the Second Wave option, ""Not Created Equally"",  to randomize starting stats:


  On one hand a Rookie can start out with a Will stat of 59 and Aim of 80 which is significantly better than the standard stats while on the other hand you can also end up with one with a Will of less than 30 and Aim less than 60 which is substantially worse than standard.

7160,Simulating an automotive load dump with a bank of charged capacitors?,"I've been working on a data logging device that will eventually go into my personal vehicle.  I've scoured the interwebs and built what, in theory, should be a fairly stout power supply capable to handle fast transients and undervoltage and the fabled load dump.  My problem is, though... I want to actually test the power supply.

In previous questions that I've asked related to the design of the power supply portion, I've been told that the ""right way"" to simulate a load dump is with a proper, preofessional testing device.  I'm curious, though... what's stopping me from rigging up something that is ""close enough""?

My idea is simply this: get a low-voltage DC power source, such as an old PC power supply.  Get a DC-DC converter to step that 12V up to something in the 80V range.  Assemble a bank of capacitors to get me in the neighborhood of a theoretical 12V load dump..  which from what I can tell is in the hundreds of joules range.  Once charged, simply connect it to the battery input of the device - which wouldn't be connected to an actual power source lest I want to potentially screw that power source up - and see if explodes, and if not, see if it works normally afterwards.

Does this sound like the dumbest idea you've ever heard?  Is it a somewhat decent idea that simply needs a lot of planning and number checking to in order to work roughly as intended?
",Toby Lawrence,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/9711,"A load dump is what happens to an automobile electrical system when a large load (such as the headlights) switches off. The problem is that the charging system (primarily the alternator) has significant inductance, and any attempt to rapidly reduce the current draw results in an ""inductive kick"" that creates a large voltage spike on the 12V bus. This kick is the same phenomenon used to create the spark in the ignition system, just a different manifestation of it. The point is, any equipment that's attached to the 12V bus needs to be able to withstand these occasional 100-200V voltage spikes without damage.

Since load dump is primarily an inductive phenomenon, it would probably be easier to simulate it that way, too. You don't really need to simulate the full energy of an actual automotive load dump; you just need to create the same voltage waveform across the supply terminals of your device.



Put a largish inductor (L1, on the order of 1H, perhaps the primary of a large power transformer) in series with your device (i.e., connect the device to the power supply through the inductor). This represents the inductance of the automobile charging system.

Put a few &micro;F of capacitance (C1) across (in parallel with) your device; this represents the distributed capacitance of the automobile wiring, and helps to limit the risetime of the load dump event. Make sure this capacitor is rated for a few hundred volts.

Put a 120&Omega; resistor (R1) in parallel with your device, too. This represents other static loads within the automobile, and will set an upper limit on the peak voltage that the load dump creates. (This resistor will be drawing 100 mA and dissipating 1.2W.)

Now, connect a low-value, high-power resistor (R2) across your device, in series with a switch (SW1). This represents the load that is going to get ""dumped"". The value of the resistor should be such that the DC current doesn't exceed the power supply's capability, and you can adjust the value of the resistor to change the current with respect to the value of the inductor to dump a specific amount of energy (0.5&times;I2&times;L). For example, if your inductor is 1H and your resistor is 12&Omega; (@ 12W), you'll be drawing 1A, and the stored energy will be 0.5 Joules.

Close the switch to ""charge up"" the inductor, then open it &mdash; there's your simulated load dump event. With these resistor values, the peak voltage will be on the order of 100-120V. You can use different combinations of resistor values to simulate different kinds of events. The ratio of R1 to R2 approximately determines the peak voltage of the spike (relative to the power supply voltage). Scale both resistors downward to simulate higher-current (higher-energy) events. Make the capacitor smaller to get faster risetimes; 1H and 1&micro;F resonate at 160Hz, which gives you a fairly leisurely 1.5ms risetime (1/4 cycle). For example, changing C1 to 0.01&micro;F would give you a risetime of about 150&micro;s.

The student information is the parent of all the other. Have that be the head section of your page, it should stay constant and as the main ""breadcrumb"" of the data. Then, use the semesters (if you're tracking years, use those first) as containers for the classes.

For the semesters, you could use tabs. Under the student information you could tab across each semester to see the class listing. This could be a table list view or an accordion. There are lots of options here.

From the list view, I would have a detail view that you could bring in with a number of different interactions for the assignments (modals, accordions, etc). Depending on if the assignments are actionable or not; are they an archive of completed assignments or a way to get to current assignment information? That would change how you show them I think.

I know that's hard to process in words, so I'd take a look at other UI that's have similar issues. Ones that come to mind are project tracking or high-end todo list apps.

8749,Radio Waves reach in function of frequency,"What is the relationship between the reach of a RF signal and its frequency?

What I mean is: If power is kept constant, should I use high or low frequency waves to get a better reach? Why?
",Rafael Dazcal,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/11101,"In free space, it doesn't matter.  The power per incident area of a propagating wave is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the transmitter.  This is true regardless of frequency.

Certain frequencies are reflected, refracted, absorbed, and scattered differently by different materials.  There is no single monotonic relationship until you get to really high energies, like gamma rays and beyond.  At these really high energies (high frequencies), the waves basically just blast thru any material in their way, with higher energies passing thru material with less attenutation.  Up to below Xray frequencies, there is no single answer, and it depends on the material between the transmitter and receiver.

Diffraction effects can make low fequencies (long wavelengths) appear to bend around objects, but this actually occurs at all wavelengths.  The ""near"" layer where diffraction effects occur scales with wavelength, so it appears to us at a fixed human scale that long wavelengths go ""around"" objects where short wavelengths don't, but that is due to our perception scale.  On the scale of the earth, commercial AM radio frequencies around 1 MHz are low enough to diffract around the curvature of the earth to some extent making over the horizon AM reception possible.  Commercial FM radio, being 100x shorter wavelength, exhibits this effect much less for the same size earth, so FM radio appears to us to be mostly occluded by the horizon.

Today, we moved a box and saw a strange waxy looking white gunk on the floor after moving a box.  Unknowingly, I scraped it off with my fingernails.  Now, I am pretty sure I scraped off the top layer of my wood floors finish.

I read about wood floor finishes.  Some say I should try to match the floor's finish, but I don't know what it is.  Others have said polyurathane can just be brushed on.  

The wood and stain appear to be fine, but this waxy stuff on top I destroyed.  Its about a 36sq in area that I destroyed.

",P.Brian.Mackey,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/1707,"This is an educated guess only because I can't really see or feel what you are describing.  This may be old floor wax that has had something damp left sitting on it. Often in older homes folks would use old fashion floor waxes that will discolor or turn white with age, water, friction or heat.  You may first try using a little mineral spirits or a mild cleaning agent with a polishing compound, such as Bar Keepers Friend with a soft cloth on a small spot to see if it will remove the white residue. If in fact this floor has been treated with a wax product, the entire floor would have to be stripped of wax, perhaps buff sanded and restained, then protected with a few coats of Urethane. Don't attempt to apply urethane until you have determined what is causing the white waxy residue. Putting any coating such as urethane over a waxed floor will bubble, peel, and create a mess to clean up. another test you could do would be to gently scrape a very small section of the white stain with a putty knife. If the material comes off easily it may be wax.  it may be old varnish, but that would not feel waxy, but not out of the question.  Let us know what you find, and we can go from there.  Good Luck

3907,Two different analytic curves cannot intersect in infinitely many points,"A curve in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \geq 2$ is $analytic$ if the coordinates of its points $x= x_{1},...,x_{n}$ can be expressed as analytic functions of a real parameter $x_{i}=x_{i}(t)$, $i=1,...,n$ and $\alpha \leq t \leq \beta$ and the derivatives $x'(t_{0})$ do not simultaneously vanish for any $t_{0} \in [\alpha, \beta]$.
I search for a proof of the following fact:

If the set of intersection points of two analytic curves is infinite, then these curves coincide.

Can we prove the same as above if we relax the condition that the coordinates are analytic to the condition that the coordinates belong to the class $C^{\infty}$?

Edit: Thanks to below remark by Ramiro, to obtain the above implication, we have to assume that any two curves $K_{1}, K_{2}$ as in the question are such that $K_{1} \cap K_{2}$ is not another analytic curve.

2nd edit: As suggested Peter, we can reformulate our question as follows:
   Consider two immersed curves which are parameterized real analytically on compact intervals. If they have an infinite number of different intersection points, then their union is again a real analytic immersed curve. 
",Grzegorz Tomkowicz,https://mathoverflow.net/users/31376,"Wrong: $t\mapsto \binom{t}{\sin(t)}$ and $t\mapsto\binom{t}{\cos(t)}$.

Edit: Grzegorz pointed out that $t$ is in a compact interval $[\alpha,\beta]$.
Under this assumption the statement is correct.

Proof: Let $f,g:[\alpha,\beta]\to \mathbb R^n$ be the two real analytically parameterized curves which intersect in $f(t_i)=g(t_i), i=1,2,\dots$ different points. Then the $t_i$ have accumulation points in $[\alpha,\beta]$, thus $f$ and $g$ coincide on $[\alpha,\beta]$.

In the $C^\infty$ case the statement is wrong: Let $[\alpha,\beta]=[0,1]$ and consider
$$f(t) = \binom{t}{e^{-1/t^2}\sin(1/t)},\qquad g(t)=\binom{t}{0}.$$

2nd edit: Noam pointed out that my proof above was not conclusive. 
So let me try again: Suppose that $f(t_i)=g(u_i)$ for sequences of distinct points.
The $t_i$ have accumulation an point $t$ and the $u_i$ have an accumulation point $u$.
By continuity, $x=f(t)=g(u)$. Now we change both parameterizations as follows:
Choose a line $r\mapsto x + r.v$ for a vector $v$ such that both curves are transversal to the hyperplane $v^\bot$. Since both curves are immersions (if I understood the question right),
such $v$ exists. Now consider the orthogonal projection of both curves onto this line. In a neighborhood of $r=0$ these are real analytic diffeomorphisms, so their inverses gives us new parameterizations of both curves in the parameter $r$. There are still infinitely many intersection points of the two curves near $x$, but these intersections happen now at the same 
parameter values $r_i$ with $r_i\to 0$ without loss. Now my proof from above applies. 

I hope that I did not overlook something else this time. Many thanks for pointing out my mistakes. 

3rd edit: I overlooked again something (Thanks SJR and Ramiro). So what I proved is:
The intersection of the two curves contains an open interval in each curve. Note that each curve, as an immersion, is locally a real analytic submanifold.  

4th edit: Grzegorz, to the new question you posed in the comment, the following comes to my mind:
By a theorem of Whitney, any closed set in $\mathbb R^n$ is the zero locus of a smooth function. So take a set in $\mathbb R$ like the Cantor set which in uncountable, and a smooth function on $\mathbb R$ vanishing exactly on this set. The graph of this function and the $x$-axis are two $C^\infty$-curves which intersect in this set.

What do mean by: $K_1\cap K_2$ is not $C^\infty$?

5th edit: Grzegorz, instead of excluding Ramiro's example in your edit of the question,
you could reformulate as follows:

Consider two  immersed curves which are parameterized real analytically on compact intervals.
If they have an infinite number of different intersection points, then their union is again a real analytic immersed curve.

139,I want to build a portable railgun and I'm a complete rookie,"I'd like to enter the world of electronic hobbies by making a railgun, and so far I know that I understand the basics of the device and that I need high amounts of direct current.

However, I am puzzled, as to where to begin calculating. I'd like to set myself X amount of joules/kjoules of electric energy and work from that, but I know stuff like rail length and how the rails push eachother apart would affect performance, so I'd like to know;


How Farads relate to Joules (I know the J/V^2 formula but that wasn't clear enough)?
Should I opt for a single powerful capacitor or a bunch of smaller ones, especially since I want to unload the charge as fast as possible?
What kind of conductive metal should I use that would be both conductive enough for acceleration and durable enough to resist the recoil and other forces involved?
How should I cool it or deal with the heat? 
Would there be much heat to begin with in a portable railgun?
Would ABS coating be a proper body for the gun, protecting the user from the lethal amperages that will be involved?
How exactly does rail length help the case, as I would use a bipod for a long rifle if that will increase my efficiency?
Would it be a better idea to have conductive bullets, insulated bullets with discarding and conductive sabots, or a stable aperture that will simply stop at the end of the barrel by whatever means I can come up with while letting the unbound insulated bullet out? 
Should I keep my circuit simple as to just use switches, a battery, capacitor, and some LEDs, or are there more efficient circuit components?
I'd like to have a control mechanism that lights the Red LED when it is charging, green when it is charged, how can I do that? In my simple sketchup of the circuit I have V-switches (don't know the technical name) aligned in a way that the lights should light correctly during the course of my planned three stage trigger, but better ideas are obviously welcome.
Will a capacitor lose its current when neither of the ends are connected to a complete circuit but both of them have wires attached to them? I am guessing not but better safe than sorry.
Is there a way to make sure the capacitor has depleted its entire charge? 
What would be a good idea to improve safety and efficiency?


Thanks in advance!
",lychnus,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/23933,"A 10g projectile moving at 100m/s has a kinetic energy given by 1/2 m (v^2), ie 50J.

Assume 10% efficiency, so you need to supply 500J from the capacitor bank. Assume we're using your 16milifard suggested number. Rearrange F = J/V^2 to V = sqrt(J/F). That yields a comparatively modest 176V. Of course, that's the energy in fully charging them, and you can't use all of it due to the voltage drop.

Assume a 50cm rail and a stationary projectile to start (in practice they're launched in mechanically). By s = (v1 + v2) t/2 that gives us 1/100s time of acceleration. That yields an instantaneous power of 50kW and current of ~280A. Delivering that kind of current requires extremely low resistance wiring and busbars and will be quite hard to achieve in a portable design. I suspect that a practical design will use a higher voltage to offset this problem and offset the voltage drop as the capacitors discharge. Perhaps only the top 10-20% of charge can be used effectively.

Putting switches in the power path is to be avoided as the current will tend to weld them shut.

Heat issues: one shot will dump a few hundred J of heat into the rails and air around them. Air cooling will do for low rates of fire.

Safety: is a relative term. You're never going to get this thing CE approved. Shrouding the whole thing in ABS (or PVC piping) to keep fingers away from high voltage, temperature, and moving parts is a good start. I'd apply an insulating varnish or conformal coating to all exposed metal on the internals (except rail active surfaces) as well, as an attempt at double-insulation and to keep out moisture.

Charge indicator: this is really the least of your problems. Start with a voltmeter.

Cap discharge: they will stay charged to lethal voltages! ""Bleeder resistors"" are usually used to drain them off. Note that discharging a 500J pack through a 1W resistor will have to take at least 500 seconds. Voltmeter comes in handy here for watching the discharge.

Sabot: I don't think this is normally done, and it complicates the whole thing hugely.

Construction: you have a bit of a mechanical engineering problem in ensuring that the rails are securely fixed but at the same time electrically isolated from each other and the chassis. You can get insulators to fit around screws and bolts, but the clearance required to do this at kV levels may be a problem.

Getting the rails parallel enough and contacting the projectile without too much friction or arcing is also going to be a problem.

Both appear to be correct.   I have seen both formats in a variety of places.
",BVDL,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/10006,"Both are indeed correct. An article is only necessary in the superlative (or comparative) if the adjective is attributive (i.e. is in the same phrase as the noun it is describing).

Consider the following examples:


  
  Example #1:
  
  John is the fastest boy.
  *John is fastest boy.
  
  Example #2
  
  John is the fastest among his friends.
  John is fastest among his friends.
  
  


As is shown in the examples above, omitting the in #1 causes it to become ungrammatical, as the superlative fastest is in the same phrase as its noun boy. In #2, however, the may be freely omitted as it is not attributive.

Some English superlatives, however, use the adverb most, which can cause some amount of confusion. Consider the following examples:


  
  Mary is the most beautiful.
  Mary is most beautiful.
  Mary is a most beautiful woman.
  


All three of these examples are grammatical and show the overlap of an adverbial intensification with the superlative. With the definite article the, it can only be a superlative, but with the indefinite article a it can only be interpreted adverbially (i.e. essentially the same as ""very beautiful""). Both of these forms, however, allow omission of the article, and so the meaning of #2 is left ambiguous.

Note that there is a third form which is related to the superlative known as the elative. While it is not a separate inflection, it can be shown to exist in constructions such as the following:


  
  It is with the greatest pleasure [...]

Like you, I choose not to mirror my low-rated photos to the export sets, for example, a perfect job for Smart Collections.

If you use the built-in Hard Drive publish service instead, you get a flat folder of images, with name collisions resolved rather brutally.

For some reason, photo names don't always survive a trip through the Folder Publisher intact. If I have a 1.jpg in two different folders, they seem to get a unique number appended anyway, even though it isn't actually necessary. I suspect this is a limitation of the Lightroom programming API. There are a lot of such areas, where the limits of Adobe's own needs for the API get reflected into the API, so that Adobe's limitations become your limitations.

That problem doesn't really bother me, though, since the name of a photo file is of minimal concern. If I ever had to rebuild my Lightroom library from a Dropbox snapshot (shudder) I'd be much more interested in the folder structure and the photo metadata, both of which the Folder Publisher plugin preserves.

About the only metadata you lose are things like virtual copies and stacks.

Obviously you're also baking photo adjustments (DNG + XMP) into JPEGs when doing this. You should have a separate ""real"" backup.

I consider my Dropbox export to be a ""my house burned down and then my city was hit by an asteroid and then it slid into an abyss"" sort of backup. As for the Aperture export, photo names, the distinction between multiple JPEGs and virtual copies, and stacking is of no concern whatsoever.

Another option you can look into is LR/TreeExporter. I used to use it, but it hasn't been updated since the LR3 days, and at the time I started using it, the jf Folder Publisher plugin hadn't been created yet. Jeffrey is more responsive, and I like the way the plugin works better besides.

For the app functionality, I have need to be able to respond to the UIWebView's nested UIScrollView events like scrollViewWillBeginDragging, scrollViewDidScroll, etc. 

The only way I can get access to the scrollView is to (it seems like a hack) go in and get it by the subviews array:

for (id subview in webView.subviews){
    if ([[subview class] isSubclassOfClass: [UIScrollView class]])  {
        UIScrollView * s = (UIScrollView*)subview;
        s.delegate = self;
        s.tag = 1;
        scrollView = s;
    }

But that seems to introduce more problems than it's worth, because I lose native UIScrollView stuff like zooming.

So to sum up what I'm needing:

What is the best way to set my UIViewController class as the delegate of the UIScrollView inside of the UIWebView? Is there something I need to do with subclassing my own UIWebView so that it handles events from it's built in UIWebView a certain way and then pass it along somehow to the UIViewController?

Please advise!

Thank you!
",Stephen J.,https://stackoverflow.com/users/647565,"
Have you checked there is only one UIScrollView subclass in the subviews? Bung in a log in your loop to see. If there is more than one, then you'll only pick up the last one using your code.
If there is just one UIScrollView subclass, you could try saving a reference to its delegate and then in your own delegate methods passing messages on after you have done your business.


So, in your loop, something like

originalDelegate = s.delegate


And then for the delegate methods, something like:

- (void) scrollViewDidScroll: (UIScrollView*) scrollView;
{
     // do your stuff

     [originalDelegate scrollViewDidScroll: scrollView];
}


You might need to check whether originalDelegate responds to the selector before calling it, i.e. if ([originalDelegate respondsToSelector: @selector(scrollViewDidScroll:)) etc. If it were me, I'd start by implementing all twelve delegate methods defined in the UIScrollView delegate protocol.

Not tested this, so will be interested to know if it can be made to work. Do note, the docs explicitly say that UIWebView ""should not be subclassed""

For instance when I printed a desaturated yellow building it looked noticeably warmer than on my display in Adobe RGB


",DavyCrockett,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/19616,"Short Answer

You should not actually convert your images directly into the printer space, as you then actually lose the ability to properly color manage your results.

For color management to work, each device involved in the process needs to be assigned a color profile. The image should be assigned an appropriate color space itself, and that is usually sRGB, AdobeRGB, or ProPhotoRGB. The color space, when assigned to an image, is the images color profile. The computer screen should be assigned its own separate color profile, usually by using a color profiling tool with a matched software package. Finally, if printing, the printer should also have a color profile, which is selected when printing actually takes place.



Color Spaces

Color spaces define how the colors of an image fit within the available known range of color, officially called L*a*b*, or just Lab for short. The Lab space models the entire range of known color as far as the human eye can perceive it, according to studies done by the IE in the 1930s. Standard color spaces such as sRGB, AdobeRGB, and ProPhotoRGB simply define how each color as it can be described by a computer map to specific color ""coordinates"" in Lab space. It is best to only assign one of these to your images. Which one you assign does not actually matter for the most part, however the smaller the space you assign, the more difficult it will be to preserve maximum original information (i.e. sRGB is a fairly small gamut vs. ProPhotoRGB, and downconverting my require multiple colors to reference the same colors in the end.)

Screen Profiles

In order to properly observe your photographs with accurate color on a computer screen, you should calibrate it. Screen calibration is usually done with some kind of device, a colorimiter or a spectrophotometer, which measures the color output of your screen and produces a custom ICC profile specifically for it, and the environment within which it resides. 

A custom ICC profile will ensure that your screen is reproducing color as accurately as possible, and your photography should not only look more realistic (which may mean less saturated!), but it should display finer levels of contrast between pixels better, so what you see on screen should be crisper and sharper. Having a calibrated screen is not a necessity, however it is highly recommended, as comparing prints to an oversaturated screen can make you wonder why things don't seem to match up.

Print Profiles

To print accurately, you need a print profile. Note that is ""print"" profile, not ""printer"" profile. A print profile actually takes into account the printer, its inks, as well as the paper being printed on. Print is probably the most complex thing to calibrate, as so many potential factors come into play, so it is not generally recommended to create your own print profiles.

Most paper manufacturers offer ICC profiles for all of their papers and a variety of printers. At the very least, the top Epson and Canon printers will have ICC profiles from most paper manufacturers like Hahnemuhle, Illford, Red River, etc. If you do not yet have the necessary print profile, I highly recommend finding them and installing them into your system.



Image Color Management

It should be noted that the print profile calibrates the printer, ink, and paper....NOT the image. The image is calibrated by its color space. For the whole entire color space conversion process to work, Image Color Management, or ICM...a component of most computer systems these days, will handle conversion for you. So long as each component involved is properly calibrated, the image viewed on screen and the image printed should look very similar. There will always be some slight differences due to the nature of print (i.e. printing on a warm paper while your screen is calibrated to a D65 whitepoint will result in a white balance shift between the two.) 

If you assign a profile for a different component to the wrong thing, such as a print profile to an image, not only will the image look wrong on screen, but it will likely look doubly wrong in print. Keep each component assigned its proper profile from the proper pool of valid profiles, and everything should remain consistent.

9557,Planet orbits: what's the difference between gravity and centripetal force?,"My physics teacher says that centripetal force is caused by gravity. I'm not entirely sure how this works? How can force cause another in space (ie where there's nothing). 

My astronomy teacher says that gravity is (note: not like) a 3D blanket and when you put mass on it, the mass causes a dip/dent in the blanket and so if you put another object with less mass it will roll down the dip onto the bigger mass. Is this true and is this what causes the centripetal force. 
",Jonathan.,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/4,"Simple answer: gravity is a centripetal force, and can be envisaged clearly as such in Newtonian mechanics.

Centripetal just means a force that is ""radially inwards"" (""directed towards the centre""). The electric force, for example, is also clearly centripetal. (It's slightly harder to define ""centripetal"" for the magnetic force.)

Your astronomy teacher is referring to Einstein's theory of general relativity. His description is loosely an overview  of the topology (fabric) of space-time and how it interacts with matter/energy - the manifold is however 4-dimensional, not 3D.

In fact, test particles (particles which do not really disturb the gravitational field) in general relativity follow a geodesic. This is effectively a generalisation of a straight line (shortest route) of normal Euclidian space to the curved space of GR, and may be seen as the source of centripetal force in Newtonian physics.

8947,Will this wall wart supply enough power?,"I am building a little pen plotter.

It is powered by a 12V 1.0A wall wart, as well as by a standard USB connection.

There is an Arduino Duemilanove, which will draw 120mA for the Atmega328 as well as 50mA for the control pins.

Attached to the control pins are three Easydrivers, that are supposed to draw 150mA apiece, and they are connected to stepper motors with 6 Ohm windings. these easydrivers are powered from VIN.

Also powered from VIN is a 12V 2.08W fan, which will run continuously.



Will this run without blowing something up?
",Blue Ice,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/24006,"If the drivers are good, they are constant current drivers so the coil resistance is irrelevant.  The fan draws 2W/12V = 170 mA.  So far that is 150*3 + 170 = 620 mA.  If the Arduino draws another 170 on top of that, then you're looking at 790 mA.  That leaves 210 mA of margin.  So it will probably work, but I would check on exactly how much current the motors draw to make sure you're not going to get any large transients.  The Arduino may end up drawing most of its current from USB, which would give you a bit more margin.  

Edit: I suppose the Arduino will not draw any current from the USB connection.  However, 170 mA is likely worst case and the actual draw will be significantly less.  The I/O figure will probably be far less if you're just sending logic signals as those are not actualy sourcing any significant current.
