Yes, but this is what normally happened:

Engineer: we can put an input validator/parser on the backend to do 
that.

Designer: there's a JavaScript library that can do some of the 
pre-validation.

Creative Director: I want it in blue, with a zooming logo.

Engineer: can we get to that later, we need to meet functional specs.

Creative Director: You *don't* understand. *I* want it in blue.

Creative Director: Oh, and the site launches this Friday because I sent 
out a press release about our new strategic partnership with HypeCorp.

Designer: fine, we'll just put a list of countries in a drop down.

Engineer: and we can validate against that list.

Creative Director: I don't give a shit. As long as it's in blue. And 
has a link to my press release.
