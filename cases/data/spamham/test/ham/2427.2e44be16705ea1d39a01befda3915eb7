We in the game industry know what we mean when we say that a game is 
"addictive." We think that quality in a game is a good thing: people like it, 
they keep coming back to it, and they want to play it more and more. I agree 
that it's a good thing. If a game has that quality, then it's probably a darn 
good game. But using the word "addiction" to describe that quality does us no 
favors with the general public.
