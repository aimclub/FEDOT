Who's the real monster?


It seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that
dares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too
strong a case.  So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're
some sort of monsters, violent ones no less.

Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people
are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their
way.

Yeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.

The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and
improving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be
sure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move
forward.  How is that being monstrous?

Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's
perception of them?  If you haven't already, contact them and ask them how
they feel about this foolishness.

Dave deflects what he can't take the time to understand


It's really quite pitiful.  When normal people don't understand something
they usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek
the help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off
and looking like fools.

What Dave does is just the opposite.

Posts a link to something he doesn't understand
Get's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it
Derides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it.
Expects others to do research for him
Abuses anyone who tries to help him
Pontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue
Realizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself
Plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy
Tries making the educated people look like fools.
Sends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.
Exposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.
Deflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1
His continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be
true.  Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  He'd rather have you
follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth
trying.

One reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  "It's like that movie The
Poseidon Adventure.  Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the
passengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don't know about
you but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.
The ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot."

Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach
around.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would
good ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It's all about love, right?  To hell
with asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he
savages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing
all the trouble.

We've news for you Dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking
amongst ourselves about it.  We're routing around you damaging behavoir.
That's where we're coming from.

If you have an example of how you've tried to help Dave, please drop us an
e-mail about it.  We'll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it
along to zaphod@egroups.com

Trying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...


The trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.

Another developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it's fundamentally
impossible:

His basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web
developers are doing a terrible job.

In the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that
people at other tables start whispering "that guy is an idiot..."

The zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers.  If you've got a similar
tale from the mud pit, be sure to drop us a line at: zaphod@egroups.com.

Aha! Some backing down by the whining one?


It would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that Dave's been trying on
his crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.

I'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.
Still have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for
time-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have
to prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A
busy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people
who make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any
deal-stoppers.

Hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use
it!

The poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They're going to be
dragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So
with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their
content into totally unsupported garbage!!!

Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start
getting rejected!

Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter
fucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his
'blame America' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed
with his dictator release of RSS.  Now he's trying to pretend we should be
nice to him because he's still recovering?

Uh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking
fights.  We'll still kick your ass regardless.  That's what years of your
abusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.

Dave is Scary on 9/11

Posted on Scripting News on 9/10/2002:


Note: During the day tomorrow there will be no updates to Scripting News.
I'll be in SF at Seybold, leading a discussion on Web Services for
Publishing with people from Amazon, Apple, Google and Jake Savin of
UserLand. I may be able to update my Radio weblog, but only if there's
something really important to report. So best wishes for a happy and safe
9-11.
What kind of asshole wishes people a happy 9/11??!?!?!?!??!! Obviously
someone who doesn't have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy.

Yeow and we though we were harsh!


Wow, apparently Dave's sticking his neck out quite far these days.  Craig
Schamp practically keel-hauls him with this one.  He wraps it up with:

The man seems to show over and over that he's nothing more than a whining
buffoon

Give that man an honorary Zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring!

RSS 2.0: code name "Hitler"


If Dave tries to steamroll RSS 2.0 through without formal community
consensus, here now we call it the "Hitler" release of 2.0.

"No objections"?  No, he means "No objections I choose to hear."

Dave is simply not listening.  People are objecting all over.

Luserland Attempts to Trademark "RSS"


Dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any
BigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally
bankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.

So we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried
to patent the term 'RSS' back in 2000. Here's the patent application:

http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336

This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development
efforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS
1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.

Could Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!

Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others
to do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:

Tim O'Reilly says patents are OK, he's just against stupid patents. In the
spirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.
There's no way to route around them.

When's a Permalink not a Permalink?


When Dave writes an item, then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! The permalink links to
nothing at that point. So apparently the "perma-" part in permalink is
permanent. For everyone except Dave. Too bad his little attempt at a
definition fails to mention this...!!!!!!!!!
