Did you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person is
sexually active or not?

1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when woman
   make love they produce more of the hormone estrogen, which makes
   hair shiny and skin smooth.

2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering
   dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses
   the pores and makes your skin glow.

3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that
   romantic dinner.

4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches
   and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable
   than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!

5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body
   endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and
   leaving you with a feeling of well-being.

6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually
   active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called
   pheromones.  These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!

7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE
   EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.

8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages
   saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid
   that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.

9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release
   the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.

10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a national
    antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.

ENJOY SEX!
