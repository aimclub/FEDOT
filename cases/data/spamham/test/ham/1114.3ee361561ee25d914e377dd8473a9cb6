Halloechen!

I have

Requires: saxon >= 6.5.1
Conflicts: saxon >= 7

in my spec file.  But apparently rpm ignores all version numbers. So,

Requires: saxon >= 6.5.1
# Conflicts: saxon >= 7

would install even with saxon-3.0.0, and

# Requires: saxon >= 6.5.1
Conflicts: saxon >= 7

wouldn't install even with saxon-6.5.2.  What could be the reason
for this?

Tschoe,
Torsten.
