My problem is not the same as MS's one, I don't have to deal with millions of 
identical copy of the same CD with propably millions of working keys.  Each 
download can be unique with a small preparation delay.  The key generator is 
a problem only if multiple keys are usable.  If the end users are teenagers, 
you'll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we 
think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients 
personnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible 
steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.

I agree with all of you that mass production CDs will not be safe from piracy 
in a near futur.  That can be seen as a collateral of mass market 
penetration.

BTW thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight.  I'm playing with 
gdb's dissassembler now but I don't think it's what a typical cracker would 
use.  Any hints on UNIX cracking tools ?

Thanks.
