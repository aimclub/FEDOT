Heh. I hit the same problem, but the other way round, when I first
started playing with this - I'd collected spam for a week or two, 
then mixed it up with randomly selected messages from my mail boxes.

course, it instantly picked up on 'received:2001' as a non-ham. 

Curse that too-smart-for-me software. Still, it's probably a good
thing to note in the documentation about the software - when collecting
spam/ham, make _sure_ you try and collect from the same source.
