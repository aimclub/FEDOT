No that is appropriate content for the file.  I'm not a C programmer,
but I think that these sort of things (#include <blahblah>) are
instructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile
process, and include all sorts of symbols/functions
e.g. "#include <math.h>" gives you maths type functions.  Since they
start with "#" they are ignored in the final compilation.

Regarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel
software to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. 
I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag
    --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4
which could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate
directory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to
persuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think this
is the right way to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the steps above regarding "make dep" and so forth
should have been performed in the directory where the make process is
looking for modversions.h & Co.

I don't think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as
you describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which you
have done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after
that, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h)
files.  This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files
don't really belong there).

For what it's worth I think you are very close to a successful
compilation.
