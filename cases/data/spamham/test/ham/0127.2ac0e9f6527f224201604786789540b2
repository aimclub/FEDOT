Your actual serial number is 1519761310 - from a dig I've just done.

Try resetting the zone number to 2002082901 - some of your secondaries seem 
to have a serial number below that, so they clearly regard 1519761310 as 
being less than 2002082601.

That should enable them to pick up the new zonefile.
