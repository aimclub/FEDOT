I don't know a lot about ALSA, but use custom kernels for many of the 
machines -- would this mean, in order to get mplayer (eg) to work, I'd 
first have to compile a custom kernel option? or kernel module? Since I 
wouldn't have your alsa-kernel(??) installed, would that mean alsa-libs 
and so on won't install?

(I guess, in short, if it *requires* the shipped kernel to be used, I'd 
be against --with-alsa as a default?)
