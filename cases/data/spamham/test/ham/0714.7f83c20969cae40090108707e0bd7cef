Polite and respectful protest is acceptable then. No dumping tea in the 
harbour or anything like that.
I think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on 
television, and that the tactics can be
justified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative 
viewpoints from that medium. On the other hand,
it was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault, and 
the protestors were not in anybody's face
(at least in my understanding of the vernacular).

And no, being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence 
politicians, but the standard way of using lobbyists and
writing checks is beyond many of us.
