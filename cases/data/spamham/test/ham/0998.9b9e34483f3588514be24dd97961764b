What, like i'm not skilled with a bow? You better run really fast :-P

Well lets see, about 99% of all anime? In anime dead people can talk, email,
hang out, and generally lead normal lives. Come to think of it they tend to
be the primary characters ;)

But I suspect you mean Serial Experiments Lain, in which the initial "i'm
not dead yet" is via email.
