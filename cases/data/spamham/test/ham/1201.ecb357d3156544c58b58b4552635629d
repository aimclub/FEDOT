Well, I think my avifile build still needs the win32 codecs to be able to
run (manually copied into /usr/lib/win32/), but personally, I've been very
happy with mplayer's default (which is ffmpeg's ffdivx decoder) for nearly
all the DivX files I used. The only ones that still require (from my own
experience) the use of the win32 codecs are the ones encoded with a strange
DivX 3 sound format... and I've really not seen any quality or speed
improvements when using them.
