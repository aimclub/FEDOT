What is silly and antiquated depends a lot on which country you live in.

I don't have statistics on the love half life, but it seems long-term 
relationships use something else for glue.

Clearly our non-silly non-antiquated ideas about relationships have
resulted in mostly short-duration relationships and single-parented,
dysfunctional kids (not enough of them too boot, so to keep our
demographics from completely keeling over we're importing them from places
with mostly silly and antiquated ideas).

At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and
counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we're doing
something wrong.

Maybe we should really go dirty Tleilaxu all the way.
