Trust me when I tell you that heavy medication and RDF do not mix. Here is a 
list of things I intend to re-read once the fog lifts: 

- _Phil Ringnalda_: Using FOAF relationships[1] and Just say no to Trackback in 
index.html[2]. 
- _Les Orchard_: Per-post comment RSS feed[3]. 
- _Phil Wainewright_: The bare necessities of RSS[4] and What to do about RDF
[5]. The beginning of an RSS 2.0 best practices document. 
- _Jonathon Delacour_: Trying to score a goal[6]. &#8220;As the best and the 
brightest focus on the possibilities of FOAF, I turned my attention to 
yesterday's news: RSS.&#8221; No, RSS will always be today's news. Get it? 
Today's newzzz... Never mind. 
- Comments on Ben Hammersley's Friend of a Friend[7]. Various ways to link to a 
FOAF file from an RSS feed. 
- _Nicholas Chase_: The Web's future: XHTML 2.0[8]. We're losing backward 
compatibility, isn't that great? Well, he seems to think so. 
- mod_cc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such 
as RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files. 
- _Shelley Powers_: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to 
accomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing 
list[11]. Also the comments on Shelley's article[12]. 
- _Ian Hickson_: Pingback 1.0[13]. &#8220;The best thing about this idea is 
that unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both 
users.&#8221; 
- New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14]. A press release 
for a new edition of LIFT[15], which I have never used. 
- Forget Mars bars, Twinkies now the deep-fried treat[16]. &#8220;The secret to 
making a deep-fried Twinkie, he says, is to place it in the fridge first to 
give it more stability. He then rolls it in flour, covers it with batter ... 
and plunks it into the oil.&#8221;
