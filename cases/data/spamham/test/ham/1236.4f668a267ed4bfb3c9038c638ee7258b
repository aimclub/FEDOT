  | Restarting exmh was necessary.

Probably not.   Next time try clicking on the folder name in the
sequences window for the sequence.   That is, request that sequence
be the one displayed in the FTOC.   If the sequence doesn't exist,
it will be cleaned up then.

Perhaps it would be nicer if flist would do it as well, but this
is effective enough.
