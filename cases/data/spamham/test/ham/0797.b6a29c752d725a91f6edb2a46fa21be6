Sorry... I just had a run-in with a neighbor whom I've never met before who
pigeonholed me within one minute after I asked a question - he said 'Are you
one of them environmentalists?' For some reason that narrowminded attitude
of not listening to what I was saying and categorizing me into a box in his
little paranoid republican fantasy world just pissed me off.

Sheesh... I've been out of work too long...
