Actually, it means just the opposite. The first
amendment guarantees Harley's right to say just
that. For the outlets where he has editorial
control, it even guarantees his right to CENSOR
content published through those outlets. The
first amendment doesn't limit Harley's speech,
and it is neutral with regard to the selection
policies of FoRK and other private venues.
