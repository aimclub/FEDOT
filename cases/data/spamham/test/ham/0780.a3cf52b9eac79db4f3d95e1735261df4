Hmm, if the shoe fits... I think these five attributes could more or 
less describe various actions of the US over the past decade or so...

The first part of this doesn't really fit, except in isolated cases - 
certainly not en mass. The second part though... Hmm...

Well, think about it.

We already have weapons of mass destruction, but are actively developing 
bigger and better ones.

Heheh... Anyone know about the 'School of the Americas'? What about the 
monies, supplies, and training that supported the contra rebels? Oh, I 
forgot, their government was "bad" and needed to be overthrown (with out 
help).

Basic human values like the first ammendment? The fourth ammendment?

Sorry, Shrub, your political newspeak is falling on deaf ears. Oh, 
sorry, maybe I should self-censor my thoughts to avoid being put in a 
're-education camp' by Ashcrofts gestappo? Gads, maybe someone on FoRK 
has joined your T.I.P.S. program and became an official citizen spy?


In disgust,
