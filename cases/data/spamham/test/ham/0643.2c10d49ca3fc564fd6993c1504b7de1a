X-Spam-Level: 

First, it was my understanding that they had the food before they
refused to pay.  I often have the goods in my possession before I settle
the paycheck.

Second, 'not being paid for a little food' is an awfully big deal in
India.  It isn't far from stealing the only food my children have so
I'll have to watch them starve.  The margin of survival is very, very,
thin.

So yes.  In my particular reality distortion field 'not paying for a
little food' in India is akin to a direct act of violence intended to
cause suffering if not death on the victims family.  That such an act
triggers a violent response is, IMHO, hardly surprising.

In other words, as far as I could tell the people on the train fired the
first shot.

With all of that said I still don't know if this happened or not.  Nor
do I know for sure that the margin of survival for those Muslim vendors
was that thin.
