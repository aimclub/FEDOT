--] Anyone heard of this law before?

Back when I was running the WSMF shoutcast server these restrictions were
just being placed on netcasters. Most folks laughed it off. Now with the
license fees its not laughable anymore. If you pay the fee you are bound
to the restrictions, if you dont your running the criminal line.

I still run a stream up on live365. Its been playing the same 10 hour
block of Jean Shepard shows for the last year. I really should change them
up.

If I were going to do the old WSMF shoutcast now adays I would either
spend lots of time going over regulations to see what I can or cannot do
or I would just chuck the regs out and do what I want. Or I might write
some apps to stay in regs ..I dont know..one thing is for sure it
defiently takes the spontaneous edge off things:)-
