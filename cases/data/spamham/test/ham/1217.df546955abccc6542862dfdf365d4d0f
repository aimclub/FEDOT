X-Spam-Level: 


It seems that something changed during the last 3-4 weeks.

1) In a folder, msgs 1-n is read, n=current, n upwards is unread.
2) change to another folder
3) change back to the original folder and you'll see msg n+1 being 
highlighted as current for a split second, that it changes back to 
n=current.

Kind of annoying since it marks msg n+1 as read.
