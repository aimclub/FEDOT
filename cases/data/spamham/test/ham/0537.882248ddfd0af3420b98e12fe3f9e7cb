I dunno, BB.  Women who like to be thought of this way should have the
right to choose to be treated this way.  Men too...  ahem.  (:  My boy
cleans, washes clothes, cooks, fixes stuff, etc, and works the same number
of hours I do, sometimes more, if he has to catch up with me.  (:  I
close him because he is industrious and creative, and because he
unfailingly makes my bed the minute I get out of it.  And boy #2 will be
here soon to help boy #1 with other things such as pedicures,  backrubs,
and sure, fucking.  LOL! (along with the aforementioned "chores") Adam can
have his cake and eat it too, if he can only find the right girl who has
the same beliefs about gender  roles that he has. Of course, he has NO
clue where to look, so we will be constantly laughing at him while he
stumbles around in the dark.

P.S. the numbers do not in any way indicate importance or favor -- only
the order in which they move into my house.  -smiles at chris-
P.S. #2.  I'm moving.   Going to New Orleans.  Can't handle any more cab
driving.  The summer sucked here on the MS Gulf Coast, instead of rocking
like it normally does.  Wish me luck.  I'm going to look for another
computer job.  Le Sigh.  (:
