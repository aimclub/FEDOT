Bob,

This capacitor drive idea isn't completely stupid, but neither is it well
thought out.

Maxwell (www.maxwell.com) makes and sells high energy density capacitors,
called ultracapacitors.  They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage
regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly
the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16
kilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic
energy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in
a vacuum.

Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8
kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much does
the 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet
it isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph --
the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored
electrically in the capacitor.  And it's not at all obvious that the torque
vs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do
it without wheels, drive train, etc.

But if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag!

On to the Lunarnationals?  Or would you prefer the bite of donut?
