Gimme a break.  This is remarkable for its lack of
newsworthiness.

1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and
still are) the best way to read paper tape at high speed.
You can read about it in the standard accounts, e.g.
  http://www.picotech.com/applications/colossus.html

2) For decades before that, codebreakers were using optical
computing in the form of superposed masks to find patterns.
You can read about it in Kahn.

3) People have been doing opto-electronic computing for
decades.  There's a lot more to it than just holography.

It isn't right to make it sound like three numbers (frequency,
amplitude, and phase);  actually there are innumerable
frequencies, each of which has its own amplitude and phase.

Some things that are hard with wires are easy with
light-waves.  But most things that are easy with wires
are hard with light-waves.

People were doing smaller versions of that in
the 1980s.

Not "FFTs".  FTs.  Fourier Transforms.  All you need for
taking a D=2 Fourier Transform is a lens.  It's undergrad
physics-lab stuff.  I get 6,000 hits from:

All optical???  No optoelectronics anywhere???
That's medicinal-grade pure snake oil, USP.

Photons are well known for not interacting with
each other.  It's hard to do computing without
interactions.
