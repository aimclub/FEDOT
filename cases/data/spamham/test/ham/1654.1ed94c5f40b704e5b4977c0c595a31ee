X-Spam-Level: 

The following was personal correspondence between two people.  I can't
fathom how Razor thinks it is spam:

>
> We are struggling with the decisions related to wether or not to
> go ahead with our plans to purchase an OCR and forms
> scanning solution.
>
> An outside consultant mentioned that he had heard that not to
> long ago you folks were considering implementing OCR
> technology to reduce data entry costs and improve efficiency.
> If you could let us know if you did move foreward with any

> Would you recomend we take a look at it?
> At present we are still planning to continue our research until
