Yes, them too.  When wolves attack their sheep, they coral the wolf
into a quarry and then throw rocks from the surrounding cliffs so
that "no one will know who killed the wolf"

In Samskar, before the Chinese arrived, there had not been a killing
in over 2000 years, and the last recorded skirmish, over rights to
a water hole, had happened several generations ago.
