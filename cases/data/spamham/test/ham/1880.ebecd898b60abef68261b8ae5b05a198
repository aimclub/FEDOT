[0]Theory writes "Bricolage 1.4.0 has finally escaped the shackles of its
CVS repository! ... Bricolage is a full-featured, enterprise-class
content management and publishing system. It offers a browser-based
interface for ease-of use, a full-fledged templating system with complete
programming language support for flexibility, and many other features
(see below). It operates in an Apache/mod_perl environment, and uses the
PostgreSQL RDBMS for its repository."
