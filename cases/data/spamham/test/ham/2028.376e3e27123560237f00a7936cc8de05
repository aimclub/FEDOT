You can see Cory Doctorow explain the problems with the Berman Bill while his 
host subscribes to the EFF Action Center on TechTV[1] if you've got Windows 
Media Player. If you're on Windows, you can also hear them. (The Mac version 
doesn't seem to have the codec for the sound.)

Seth[4]: "I had a dream that I went to D.C. to hear the Eldred argument and 
also dropped by a party to celebrate it. [...] y dream Supreme Court was 
definitely going to reverse the court below, if only because the Solicitor 
General in my dream had hardly found anything good to say about the CTEA. _
Adsit omen! _"
Donna of Copyfight linked to my fair use notes[5]. 

An archived stream of the Tauzin hearing will be available soon[6].
