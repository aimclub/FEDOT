Calls to La Casa's crisis line increased by 33% in the last financial
year, and the service saw a 10 percent increase in the demand for
beds, with 232 women and 215 children utilizing the shelter service.
...

services were the two main reasons for the increase in calls.

service-industry jobs utilized by dot-com workers
