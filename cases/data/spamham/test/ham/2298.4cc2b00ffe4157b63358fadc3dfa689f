Subject: Distributed.net cracks the RC5-64 cipher

The Distributed.net project -- a precursor to SETI@Home that used volunteer 
computer-time to attack giant, sophisticated ciphers -- has cracked RC564. I 
used to have half a dozen computers working on this. 

    On 14-Jul-2002, a relatively characterless PIII-450 in Tokyo returned the 
    winning key to the distributed.net keyservers. The key 0x63DE7DC154F4D039 
    produces the plaintext output: 

    The unknown message is: some things are better left unread 

    Unfortunately, due to breakage in scripts (dbaker's fault, naturally) on 
    the keymaster, this successful submission was not automatically detected. 
    It sat undiscovered until 12-Aug-2002. The key was immediately submitted to 
    RSA Labs and was verified as the winning key.
