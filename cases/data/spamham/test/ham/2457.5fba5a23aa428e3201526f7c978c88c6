NTT DoCoMo have released a paper on the use of human flesh as a networking 
medium: 

    A device attached to a PDA can send and receive weak electrical signals 
    through people, with human bodies as communications circuits, the paper 
    said, citing sources close to the companies. 

    Apparel and handbags have their own conductivity, allowing an electrical 
    connection to a PDA that can remain in one's pocket, the paper said. 

    In this way, people can exchange e-mail addresses, names and phone numbers 
    while shaking hands, with the data automatically written into both their 
    PDAs, the paper said.
