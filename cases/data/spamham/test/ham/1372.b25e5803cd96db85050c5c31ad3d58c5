This wouldn't be worth the effort involved IMHO, and would probably end up
in relative breakage of a few systems if not carefully tested.
Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier
currently :
1. Leave your current kernel as-is
2. Get the "alsa-driver" source rpm
3. Rebuild and install resulting packages

Drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,
NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported
as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.

Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in
my mind. I see it more as a "one size fits all" achievement in the general
case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized
for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules
you'll ever need. Make that "one size fits many" then if you want ;-)

Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from
in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their
systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and
other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily
use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release
without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.

PS: Yes Chris, I'm worried about not giving you too much work! Less in fact
since you can easily answer "freshrpms.net!" to people asking how to play
DVDs, right? ;-))))
