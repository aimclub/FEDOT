Dan Gillmor interviewed Jack Valenti[1] last week in his column and did the 
impartial thing, representing Valenti's beliefs as fairly as possible. This 
week, Dan takes Valenti's arguments apart, looking at what Hollywood's agenda 
really entails: 

    So the movie and music companies are going back to Congress for another 
    helping. They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to 
    restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that 
    communicate so they can't make copies the copyright holders don't 
    explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants 
    permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used 
    to violate copyrights. 

    Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the 
    possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask 
    permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep 
    information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it's nothing 
    but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a 
    certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after 
    the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some 
    things that aren't infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing. 
    Saying it doesn't make it so.
