What I meant was that neither he nor anyone else has any *authority* to 
say something can or can't be published, and make that stick, at least 
in the US, and from some descriptions, France. Of course he can say 
anything he wants. And I can choose to ignore it, or not. Works both 
ways.

Fscking semantics.
