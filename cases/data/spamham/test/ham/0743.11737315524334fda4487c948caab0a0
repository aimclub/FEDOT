It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair,
we had everything before us, we had nothing before us,
we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way
---C Dickens

G'Quon Wrote "There is a greater darkness than the one we fight. It is the
darkness of  the soul that has lost its way." The war we fight is not
against powers  and principalities - it is against chaos and despair.
Greater than the  death of flesh is the death of hope, the death of
dreams. Against this  peril we can never surrender. The future is all
around us, waiting in  moments of transition, to be born in moments of
revelation. No one knows  the shape of that future, or where it will take
us. We know only that it  is always born in pain.
--JWS
