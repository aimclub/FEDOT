Give me a mod to timtoken.py that does this, and I'll be happy to test it.

If there's any sanity in the world, even the original poster would be glad
to have his kneejerk response blocked <wink>.  OTOH, you know there are a
great many msgs on c.l.py (all over Usenet) that do nothing except quote a
previous post and add a one-line comment.  Remove the quoted sections from
those, and there may be no content left to judge except for the headers.  So
I can see this nudging the stats in either direction.  The only way to find
out for sure is for you to write some code <wink>.
