Gotta wonder what the GPG config stuff in ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults looks 
like.  Also gotta wonder what the message headers in the offending 
message are saying to nmh/exmh.  My set-up works perfectly.  That is, 
I get a pop-up window to enter my passphrase into, and when I type it 
correctly, the message display changes from a prompt to click to 
decrypt to the message content.

TTFN....

Hmm - I'm cc'ing the exmh-workers list, because I really don't know
much about the various PGP interfaces.  I think there has been some
talk about "issues" with the latest version of gpg.
