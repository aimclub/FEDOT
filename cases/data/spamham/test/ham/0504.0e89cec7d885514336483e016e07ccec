Not only do I know that, the post to which you were responding
explained that, with somewhat more detail than "a joke".  As you
should know, but evidently don't, poll() isn't even "a bit better" ---
in fact, it's about an order of magnitude worse --- for dense file
descriptor sets, which is the normal case.  (Except on operating
systems where select() isn't a system call but a library routine that
calls poll().)

Why don't you explain this in more detail?

You originally said:

  Could it be? After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally
  catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for
  nontrivial apps? No way!

The point --- my point, the point I was discussing; please don't try
to tell me you were trying to make a different point, because I don't
care --- is that you had no clue what you were talking about; Unix
hasn't been without this feature, and in fact has had it since you
were in elementary school, and operating systems without it don't
"totally suck for nontrivial apps".

For what it's worth, glibc has actually implemented the aio_* calls
for a while, just in a way that doesn't scale to large numbers of
concurrent I/O requests.  I find references to the glibc
implementation as far back as 1999 and glibc 2.1.1, and I could
probably find much earlier references if I had time:
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/1999-12/msg00070.html

Your original complaint was that Unix didn't do multithreading or
multiprogramming well.  Now that I've pointed out how obviously
idiotic that claim is, you've amended your complaint: now, although
individual Unixes do these things well, you complain that their
implementations are not entirely conformant with the POSIX threads
specification.  Well, that's probably true, but I haven't written
pthreads programs in C much myself, so I can't confirm it from my own
experience.  But, even if it's true, it's not a very good reason to
prefer Windows.

I'm sure you can provide examples of bugs in particular threading
implementations.  Spare us.  Just shut up.
