Shelley Powers raises[1] some interesting questions re whether RDF has a place 
in syndication. She says that RDF is trying to build a persistent database (aka 
the Semantic Web) and RSS is trying to flow news that has a short lifespan. I 
had not heard this point before. It's worth thinking about.
