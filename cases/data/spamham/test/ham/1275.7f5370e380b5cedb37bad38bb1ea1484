Hello,

I'm new to the list.
I wanted to find out who tried recompiling a working apt rpm for (null) or 
psyche.  I would like to get good GStreamer packages done by monday when 
it's released.

BTW, in the archive I saw some posts regarding the GStreamer repository.  
I'm not sure why they were posted on this list ;) In any case, I'm the rpm 
maintainer, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

I was trying to get an updated apt rpm from http://dave.cridland.net/, but 
the http port is closed.  Dave, if you're reading this, please let me know 
where I can get the updated rpm.

Thanks,
Thomas
