I've an XMMS Alsa module I've been using for a while now at:
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsa-xmms-0.9_cvs020630-aap1.i686.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsa-xmms-0.9_cvs020630-aap1.src.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsa-xmms-0.9_cvs020630.spec

Also there is alsaplayer rpms there too:
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.i386.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.i686.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.src.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71.spec

Good luck. Both were build on an RH 7.3 box with errata current as of the date of
the build. I'm running (null) RH beta now and I recall that alsa-xmms still works, I
can not remember if alsaplayer needs a --rebuild.

As an aside, alsaplayer is really maturing into a versitile app, I've been packaging
for many releases now.

I've scripted the alsa-xmms cvs build, so it's easy to spin another one if these
rpms do not work on (null).

That's "angle" as in geometry.
