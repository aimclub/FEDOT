In addition, one bit of anecdotal evidence from a conversation in
1984! in San Fransisco is hardly enough to extrapolate 500 to 3k.

This is the only quote I could find relating to promiscuity in
homosexual men.

"I think people feel a certain invulnerability, especially young
people, like this disease doesn't affect me. The publicity about the disease was very much the kind where it was easy to say, "That isn't me. I'm not promiscuous." Promiscuity, especially, was a piece where people could easily say, "Well, I'm not. Promiscuous is more than I do." If you have 300 partners a year, you can think you're not promiscuous if you know somebody who has 500. So it's all relative, and it was easy to feel that that isn't me."

You could find hets who have the same kind of partner volume.  BFD.
This kind of random generation of numbers that leads the nutty
religious bigots (as you mentioned earlier).

Grr.   Bits damnit.  Now, I must go brief.
