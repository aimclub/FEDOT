I think I'm going to become one of _those_ people. You know, one of those 
people who has a &#8220;Semantic Web&#8221; category on their weblog. This will 
be a Geek Purity Test question someday. Onward: 

- _Phil Ringnalda_: Fun with RDF[1]. &#8220;RDF can actually be fun, as long as 
you don't foolishly invest too much ego in trying to store RSS 1.0, or wander 
off into flame wars.&#8221; From which we find: 
- _Shelley Powers_: The RDF Query-O-Matic[2], and The RDF Query-O-Matic 
explained[3]. &#8220;The Query-o-Matic accepts the name of an RDF file (any 
valid RDF file), and an RDFQL (RDF Query Language) query, and will print out a 
test value found as a result of that query.&#8221; 
- _Marcus Campbell_: &#8220;My FOAF autocreation script is moving along nicely
[4]. It's now looping through my OPML blogroll file, checking the first load of 
bites in people's pages for head linked FOAF files, grabbing certain elements 
from these files (if they have one) and spitting them out into a brand new FOAF 
file for me.&#8221; 
- _Joe Gregorio_: The Well-Formed Web[5]. &#8220;After spending some time 
badgering poor Bill Kearney for a concrete benefit of having RDF in RSS 1.0 and 
not getting a really satisfactory answer I went back and read Paul Ford's essay 
again. I wanted to get that old religious feeling back again. It didn't work. 
The magic was gone.&#8221;
