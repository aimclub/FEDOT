One more salvo on X and cut/paste.  X specifies at least two *mechanisms*
for cut/paste, but as usual mandates no *policy*.  Windows and Macintosh
have a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy.  I'm quite
sure that Tk implements all PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections accurately.
The PRIMARY selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection
on your X display.  The CLIPBOARD selection is the one with the explicit
Copy step, and is the same as what you have on Windows and Macintosh.
However, exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism, which is
another archaic mechanism supported at one point (perhaps still today)
by versions of emacs.  Exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these
mechanisms under one umbrella, and by all reports it is not that great.

I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in
Text_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up
with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another
setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,
that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that.
