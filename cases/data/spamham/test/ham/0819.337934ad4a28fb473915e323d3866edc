Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over
regulation.

The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible.
It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over
spending spreads the damage more evenly.  Rent control would be an
example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending
tons of money on public housing.

As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose
both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  The opinion that
EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty
much anathema to liberal politics.

Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much
government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private
replacements, no government regulation) is better than government
regulation itself.

And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does not
include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a
watermelon.
