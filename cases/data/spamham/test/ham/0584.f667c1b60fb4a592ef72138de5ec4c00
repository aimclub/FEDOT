Hello,

Just a brief reminder that the deadline for submisisons for issue 2
of the

'International Journal of IT Standards & Standardization Research' (JITSR)

is October 1.

JITSR is a  new, multi-disciplinary publication outlet for everyone who
is doing research into IT standards and standardisation (from whichever
perspective).

So if you think you've got a paper that might fit - why not submit
it for JITSR?

And please do ask if you need any further information.


Greetings from Aachen.

Cheers,
Kai.

Call for Papers

for Issue 2 of the

International Journal of
IT Standards & Standardization Research


This new journal aims to be a platform for presenting, and
discussing, the broad variety of aspects that make up IT standards
research. This includes, but is certainly not limited to,
contributions from the disciplines of computer science, information
systems, management, business, social sciences (especially science
and technology studies), economics, engineering, political science,
public policy, sociology, communication, and human factors/
usability. In particular, the journal wants to both support and
promote multi-disciplinary research on IT standards; 'IT'
should be understood in a very broad sense.

Topics to be covered include, but are not limited to:

 - Technological innovation and standardisation
 - Standards for information infrastructures
 - Standardisation and economic development
 - Open Source and standardisation
 - Intellectual property rights
 - Economics of standardisation
 - Emerging roles of formal standards organisations and consortia
 - Conformity assessment
 - National, regional, international and corporate standards
   strategies
 - Standardisation and regulation
 - Standardisation as a form of the Public Sphere
 - Standardisation and public policy formation
 - Analyses of standards setting processes, products, and
   organisation
 - Case studies of standardisation
 - Impacts of market-driven standardisation and emerging players
 - The future of standardisation
 - Multinational and transnational perspectives and impacts
 - Commercial value of proprietary specifications
 - Descriptive & prescriptive theories of standardisation
 - Standards research and education activities
 - Tools and services supporting improved standardisation
 - User related issues
 - Risks of standardisation
 - Management of standards
 - History of Standards
 - Standards and technology transfer

Authors are requested to submit their manuscripts as an e-mail
attachment in RTF or PDF to the editor-in-chief at
Kai.Jakobs@i4.informatik.rwth-aachen.de.

If this form of submission is not possible, please send one hardcopy
of the manuscript together with a disk containing the electronic
version of the manuscript in RTF or PDF to:
Kai Jakobs,
Technical University of Aachen, Computer Science Department,
Informatik IV
Ahornstr. 55, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.

Manuscripts must be written in English on letter-size or A4 paper,
one side only, double-spaced throughout, and include at least 1"
(2.54 cm) of margin on all sides. The cover page should contain the
paper title, and the name, affiliation, address, phone number, fax
number, and e-mail address of each author. The second page should
start with the paper title at the top and be immediately followed by
the abstract. Except on the cover page, the authors' names and
affiliations must NOT appear in the manuscript. The abstract of 100-
150 words should clearly summarise the objectives and content of the
manuscript. Submitted manuscript should normally be 4000-6000 words
long; longer ones will be considered but may be subject to editorial
revision.

Submission of a paper implies that its content is original and that
it has not been published previously, and that it is not under
consideration for publication elsewhere. Yet, significantly extended
papers previously presented at conferences may be acceptable.
