you meant "SURPRISINGLY perceptive," didn't you?  :-)

recent exceptionally vivid and strange dreams lead me to believe i'm
sparking synapses that have lain dormant lo these many years.  Lots of
problem solving going on up there at night.

That's very perceptive of you.  Many people are not so willing to
accept their personal reality as skewed by their neuro-physiology.  A
great many popular con games exist by exploiting the perceptions of
these states.

Another oft-exploited neuro-plausibility: The brain is a pretty darn
fine analog associative computer, so it could be the neurochemical
events during the dream have associated themselves with some inner or
external cue to mentally _recreate_ the state-perception like the
predictable tone on striking a bell.
