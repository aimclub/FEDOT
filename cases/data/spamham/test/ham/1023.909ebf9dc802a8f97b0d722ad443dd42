>>
>> It is, I promise, the last thing the Bushies want projected on the

>> left the theatre with anything short of rage. I truly believe this 
>> film has
>> the potential to rock the nation and get people energized to do 
>> something.
>>
>> This is not good news for Junior and Company. Not when they are

>> drag us into another war. Not when a crazed sniper is exercising his
>> constitutional right to own a high-powered rifle. Not when John 
>> Ashcroft is

>> check

>> any
>> weapons prior to 9/11 -- because THAT, we are told, would "violate" 
>> these
>> terrorists' sacred Second Amendment rights!
>>
>> Yes, I believe this movie can create a lot of havoc -- but I will 
>> need ALL
>> of you to help me do this. Are you game?
>>
>> Last February 5th, I wrote to tell you about a book I had written and 
>> how
>> the publisher had decided to dump it because they were afraid to 
>> publish
>> anything critical of Bush after 9/11. I appealed to you to save 
>> "Stupid
>> White Men" from the shredder and to go out and buy it. I promised you 
>> would
>> not regret it, and that the book would not only be a great read but an
>> important organizing tool in gumming up the plans of George W. Bush.
>>
>> Within 24 hours, the book went to #1 on the Amazon best seller list. 
>> By the
>> fifth day, the book was already into its 9th printing. The publisher 
>> was
>> torn between its desire to kill the book or make a wad of money. 
>> Greed won
>> out, and this Sunday the book enters its 31st week on the New York 
>> Times
>> best seller list -- and its 32nd printing. This is all because of 
>> you, my
>> crazy and loyal friends. You made this happen, against all the odds.
>>
>> Now I would like to ask you again to help me with my latest work, 
>> "Bowling
>> for Columbine." It's a movie that many critics have already called my 
>> best
>> film to date. They may be right. It is certainly the most provocative 
>> thing
>> I have ever done. I have spent three years on it and, I have to say, 
>> it
>> cuts
>> deeper, harder and funnier that anything I have given you so far.
>>
>> The movie opens this Friday in New York and Los Angeles, and then in 
>> 8 more
>> cities next week. How it does in these first ten cities will determine
>> whether or not the rest of the country gets to see it. That is the 
>> nutty
>> way
>> our films are released. If it doesn't have a big opening weekend, you 
>> can
>> kiss the film good-bye. Therefore, this weekend, this film must be 
>> seen by
>> millions of Americans. Can you help me make that happen?
>>
>> "Bowling for Columbine" is not a film simply about guns or school
>> shootings.
>> That is only the starting point for my 2-hour journey into the dark 
>> soul of
>> a country that is both victim and master of an enormous amount of 
>> violence,
>> both at home and around the world. With this movie I have broadened my
>> canvas to paint a portrait of our nation at the beginning of the 21st
>> century, a nation that seems hell-bent on killing first and asking
>> questions
>> later. It is a movie about the state sponsored acts of violence and
>> terrorism against our own poor, and how we have created a culture of 
>> fear
>> that is based on the racial dilemma we continue to ignore. And it's a
>> devastating comedy.
>>
>> This film is going to upset some pretty big apple carts. No film has 
>> EVER
>> said the things I am saying in "Bowling for Columbine." I expect to be
>> attacked. I expect certain theatres will not show it for fear of
>> retribution. I expect that this movie will be a bitter pill for many 
>> to
>> swallow.
>>
>> This is why I need your help. Movies live or die based on what 
>> happens at
>> the box office the first weekend of its release. I need you, if you 
>> live in
>> the New York or L.A. area, to go see "Bowling for Columbine" this 
>> Friday
>> and
>> Saturday -- and take as many family members and friends with you as
>> possible. I guarantee you will not be disappointed -- and you may 
>> just see
>> one of the best films of the year.
>>
>> Monday night in Times Square, "Bowling for Columbine" had its 
>> premiere. The
>> crowd was amazing, as it was this past Saturday night at the Chicago 
>> Film
>> Festival. The audience kept laughing or hooting or applauding so loud
>> throughout the film that it was hard to hear the next line.
>>
>> The hate mail, the threats, the promises of retribution have already
>> started
>> to roll in to the distributor of this movie, United Artists. They are 
>> not
>> backing down. But how long will this last? I need all of you in the 
>> New
>> York
>> tri-state and southern California areas to go see "Bowling for 
>> Columbine"
>> THIS weekend -- the rest of you can see it in a couple of weeks when 
>> it
>> comes to your town. A strong opening not only means that the rest of
>> America
>> will see this film, it means that a good number of people who see it 
>> are
>> going to leave the film angry enough to get active and get involved. 
>> If it
>> does poorly, I will have a difficult time finding the funding for the 
>> movie
>> I want to make next -- a film about 9/11 and how Bush is using that 
>> tragic
>> day as a cover for his right-wing agenda.
>>
>> Don't let that happen. Don't let the NRA have one more success by 
>> stopping
>> the wider distribution of this movie. And, together, let us not remain
>> silent in our opposition to Bush's phony war against Iraq.
>>
>> If you live in New York, you can see it at the Lincoln Plaza, the 
>> Sunshine
>> and the Loews 19th St. In L.A., you can catch it at the Sunset 5, the
>> Westwood Regent, Laemmle Sunset, Laemmle Towncenter (Encino), Landmark
>> Rialto (Pasadena), and Regal University (Irvine). Also, please 
>> forward this
>> to your other friends and tell them to go see "Bowling for Columbine" 
>> this
>> weekend.
>>
>> And finally, don't miss our new website www.bowlingforcolumbine.com
>>
>> Thank you for your help with this. I feel so honored and privileged 
>> to have
>> so many people interested in my work. Last January I was getting 
>> 70,000
>> hits
>> a month on my website. Last month, I got 17 million hits. This alone 
>> speaks
>> volumes about the vast majority all of us belong to who are sick and 
>> tired
>> of what is going on and are longing for an alternative source of
>> information.
>>
>> I hope that you enjoy "Bowling for Columbine."

>> Thank you again...
