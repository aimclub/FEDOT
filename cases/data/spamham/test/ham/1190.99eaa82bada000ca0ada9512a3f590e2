I can't stand it either when it's at work or home and I'd planned on doing
something that required network access... but I really feel like I need a
break now, away from work pressure that almost drove me nuts all summer!
Ah, the joys of responsibilities... :-/

Six days without computers ahead, but six days driving my 600 Bandit
roadster bike! I won't be miserable nor get bored, don't worry for me ;-)
I also have the first Lord of the Rings book to finish (half way through
now) and the two others to read... lots of "sane" and non-wired occupations
ahead!
Oh, did I mention beer drinking with friends? :-))))

Matthias (really happy to be on holidayyyy for the first time this year!)
