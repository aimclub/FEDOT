Let me get this straight; a registry key is loaded from the server onto 
the client workstations who can modify it, then write it back onto the 
server's own registry - which is not going to use it?

What is the reason to write a registry key to a server if the server 
itself is not using it?
I don't think you should worry too much about someone travelling out of 
the hive, but again, I'm curious as to how the driver actually modifies 
the keys on the server.

And if the client writes the key back onto the server, yes, there's wide 
open for something nasty here.
Two other things spring to mind; 
1) If anyone can modify the key, how do you make sure that two users are 
not overwriting the same key, thereby causing undesirable effects.
2) If anyone have permissions to write to the key (and below), anyone can 
create thousands of extra keys under this key, thereby filling up the 
registry. The result of such a thing is obvious.

If I got this all wrong, I'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell 
me where I might have misunderstood.
