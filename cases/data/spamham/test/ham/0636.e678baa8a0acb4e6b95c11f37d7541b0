Many of the essays in Oreskes' _Plate
Tectonics_ seem to support this idea:

... and the Navy was in no hurry
to declassify any of these data,
as any uneven coverage could have
revealed the parts of the oceans
they found most interesting.

-Dave

(What do our seismic networks say
about the middle east?  I hazily
recall a story about LA reporters
asking their local geophysicists
about an early morning quake, to
be told that, as far as could be
figured, the "epicenter" was at a
negative depth, travelling near
mach speed, and presumably headed
towards Edwards)
