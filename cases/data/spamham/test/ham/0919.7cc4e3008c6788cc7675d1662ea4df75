Look for "Zygalski sheets".

By Koerner's* narrative, it wound up
being a hybrid affair: Bletchley had
mock Enigmas which cycled through the
Enigma's ~18k starting positions in a
quarter of an hour, but the Germans
started using a plugboard which then
had ~1.5x10^14 possibilities.  The
Poles noticed that there were some
patterns in the messages which were
only possible via certain plugboard
settings, and so:

So the brute force hardware allowed
precalculation of "optical" computing
devices which then narrowed down the
possibilities enough for brute force
to again be used for daily decodes,
until:

This is also easy to believe, given Dr.
Elachi's description of the 1981 Shuttle
Imaging Radar:

which makes sense, as one wishes to shift
each component of the return in proportion
to its frequency, for which one presumably
needs a glorified prism.
