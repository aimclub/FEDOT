Well, I'm sure you can recompile those game packages without ALSA anyway.
Also, note that ALSA 0.9.x has just appeared in Mandrake 9.0 and that all
previous Mandrake releases were using the incompatible, aging and now
unsupported 0.5.x series. (unless I've misunderstood)

Near to none, it should be quite straightforward :
http://freshrpms.net/docs/alsa/

The only tricky part is editing the /etc/modules.conf file, but the ALSA
Soundcard Matrix has a page for every supported card with a section you can
most of the time simply copy and paste!

I really think that with my ALSA packages, ALSA on Red Hat Linux has never
been so easy! ;-)

Cheers,
Matthias
