_Heather Hamilton_: Very Best of the World's Worst[1]. &#8220;After watching 
last night's premiere of "The Very Best of the World's Worst Drivers: 2" I 
tried to figure out what it was about these very best worst drivers that made 
them the very best, but not really _the_ very best, because if they really were 
_the_ very best, wouldn't they have been featured on "The Very Best of the 
World's Worst Drivers: 1" ?&#8221;
