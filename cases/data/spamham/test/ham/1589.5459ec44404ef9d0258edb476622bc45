IMO spamtrap data that's well-cleaned and monitored is fine.

To my mind there's 3 types of spamtraps:

  1. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps when the user closes
    the account

  2. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps several months after the
    user closes the account, scanned for newsletters, unsubscribed
    from them etc.

  3. real spamtrap addresses to trap website crawlers.

The latter 2 are the most effective, but #1 is a real PITA; it takes lots
of maintainance to avoid ham getting in there.  Some of my spamtrap data
had a few 1's contributed by ISPs, and I hadn't spent enough time sifting
for legit mail that was slipping through.  So I felt better leaving
them out for this run, apart from what I'd hand-cleaned.
