That's on a week like this that you realize that lots of porters are
European (and managed to free themselves for YAPC::Europe.) Or were they,
on the contrary, too busy in the big blue room ? On the other hand, the
number of bug reports stayed at its habitual average level.

[2]Perl Mongers web site, you'll see that it's just got a good deal
shorter. Over the last month or so, I've been making strenuous efforts to
contact all of the groups we had listed to see which ones were still
active. What you see is the result of this exercise. Almost half of the
groups have been removed because they haven't responded to my emails.

If your local group still exists but is no longer listed, then that means
that I don't have an update to date contact for your group. Please [3]let
me know if that's the case."
