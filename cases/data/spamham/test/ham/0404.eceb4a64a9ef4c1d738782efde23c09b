I haven't been to Van in years, but I do know that in Toronto, outside
of the small deeply ethnic neighbourhoods, if you stray more than 50
feet from Wellesley and Jarvis or Queen and Spadina, you're in
doughnutland; there's far more like the eateries in the Eaton Centre
than there are quaint cafes like McCaul north of Dundas, and the rare
little eateries are not brimming with lunchtime traffic (you can still
find a seat at noon at Village by the Grange)

When most of Toronto does not live in those neighbourhoods but instead
lives in Scarborough, Malton, Mississauga and Markham (franchisevilles), you
will quickly see that one or two trendy strips does not save an entire
nation.
