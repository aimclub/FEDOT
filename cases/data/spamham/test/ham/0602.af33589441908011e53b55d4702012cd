Of course, dear.  Especially without zazen training.  Veritably

It's a myth that we don't use parts of our brain.  We use it all,
always.  It's just that our culturally-induced focal-point causes most
of us to most of the time ignore and waste 99.999% of it.  "Lucid" is
a measure of notch-filter bandwidth; all stations are broadcasting,
but we only /choose/ Easy Rock 105.

For example, don't look now but your shoes are full of feet.

The sensation of toes the above statement evokes is not a "turning on"
of circuits, it is a "tuning in".  The next step, of course, is to
"drop out" :)

To paraphrase an old saw: Life is wasted on the living.
