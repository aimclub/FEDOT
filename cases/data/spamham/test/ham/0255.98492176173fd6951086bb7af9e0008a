Hi,

I've got an normal 3.5" CD-RW IDE drive that I'd like to be able to use with a
Dell Latitude CPx laptop that I've got. Does anyone know any way to enable this,
for example through the use of a special cable for the Modular Bay (where CD-ROM
or floppy drive is normally).

There is also the possibility of using a docking station, but Dell's docking
solution for the Latitude series doesn't seem to allow for the use of an IDE
drive, only SCSI... Unless someone knows of a "non-Dell" solution that's
compatible.

Anyone any ideas?

Thanks,

Darren.
