Indeed, my usual login is "dude" (and has been since long before "The Big
Lebowsky" came out ;-)), and it seems the some programs wrongly hard code
my home directory when being compiled :-(
For instance :

[dude@python dude]$ strings /usr/bin/gentoo | grep dude
/home/dude/
[dude@python dude]$ strings /usr/bin/xine | grep dude
/home/dude/redhat/tmp/xine-root/usr/share/locale

These should probably be considered bugs in the program's build process
(especially for xine, look at that!), I'll report them upstream if/when I
have some time.

Thanks for noticing this!
Matthias
