Zimbabwe eases GM stance

Zimbabwe has dropped objections to accepting genetically modified (GM) grain
so that urgently-needed food aid can be delivered, says the UN food agency.
The executive director of the World Food Programme, James Morris, said
Zimbabwe's decision would send an important message to other countries in
the region which have refused food aid because it might contain GM grain.
Until now, Zimbabwe had said it would only allow aid workers to distribute
ground maize to allay fears that GM grain could be planted.
But a Zimbabwean minister says the government has now set up a system of
checks to ensure the grain will not enter the eco-system.
There have been fears that Southern African nations could lose lucrative
export markets in Europe if they cannot certify that their crops are
GM-free.
Aid
Mr Morris announced the policy reversal after talks in Harare with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
"The fact that they have now concluded that they are comfortable in
accepting GM crops or commodities will be an important signal to other
countries in the region," Mr Morris told journalists.
"It will enable us to do our job," he said.
Aid workers say up to 13 million people in seven countries in Southern
Africa face famine. In Zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the
region, some six million people are estimated to need food aid.
The WFP says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes
of food it intends to bring into Zimbabwe in the next few months.
The government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government's
campaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has
worsened the situation, say many donors.
Lost markets
The GM row has complicated relief efforts across the region.
Zambia's president is refusing to overturn his ban on GM food aid, labelling
it as 'poison' .
Deals to mill GM food before being distributed, so that it could not be
planted, have placated fears in Malawi and Mozambique.
United States aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that
Americans eat GM maize every day.
The World Health Organisation has certified the grain for human consumption
and says it does not constitute a danger to people's health.
