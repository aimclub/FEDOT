Righ, somebody. Reminds me of the old Divorced Man's exposition of what

Just kidding, Darling...

Bob,

    Living aboard a Cessna 172 would be challenging, but I did meet a
couple at an airshow in Point Mugu in 1995 or so that had converted an
old seaplane (it was a bit larger than a PBY, I think) to something of a
floating, flying RV.  They visited a lot of airshows and covered a lot of
miles.  I'm sure maintenance (on a 50+ year old airframe), fuel (for two
large radial engines) insurance and other costs were out of my price
range, but what a hoot!

    On a more realistic note, the flight to Half Moon bay was probably 2
hours of flight time at about  $75/hour in the Cessna.  Not exactly a
cheap date, but that's nothing compared to the money I've spent on her
since.  (And loved every minute of it, Darling!!)
