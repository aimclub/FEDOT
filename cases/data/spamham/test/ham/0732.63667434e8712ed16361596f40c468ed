So outside of the occasional hit by a mafia-boy, where's the killing?

If you said mind-numbing, rights destroying, cynic-making force, I'd
agree.  But, does politics really kill?

I'm bitter atm.  Two reasons mostly:
1) I was listening to what I heard being the First Amendment
Foundation? on NPR releasing a poll noting that their
very-unscientific poll found that half the population thinks the first
amendment goes too far.   And (their quote was 1 in 5, but I'm finding
sources of 1 in 4) of the population don't even know what rights are
guaranteed in the first amendment.

2) I have a paper due that will make or break my law school career.  I
hate being a forced sheep.

baaaa....
