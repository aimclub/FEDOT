It also depends on what the fad is or what is in style.  (:

Actualy our silly antiquated ideas about relationships and love have 
resulted in the bleedings of many upon many a page (and musical  instrumnet, 
and canvas)  What's the problem if we dash a little Mrs. Dash on them?  (:  
Or cayenne.  Or ginger. (mm ask me about ginger root play).  

And let me tell you this: just because a child happens to be 
single-parented (what a word), does not mean that child is dysfunctional 
or lives in a dysfunctional home.  The govt/media/church has tried to make 
it look like there is a disintegration, when in fact, there is a coming 
together of other family members and friends to raise children.  It's not 
decaying -- it's changing.  Nothing wrong with change.
