That's why, for example, Orth is trying to catch the interest of the
military with fabrics that change color when conductive fibers stitched into
the cloth heat and cool the material's thermochromatic inks. "The army wants
fully addressable, interactive camouflage," she says, "so that when you're
standing in front of bricks, your clothing looks like bricks. When you're in
grass, you look like grass. Accomplishing that would be like a space program
for e-textiles."
