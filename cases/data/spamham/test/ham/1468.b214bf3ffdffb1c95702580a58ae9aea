A lot of spam which *appears* to originate from China, and even 
a lot which advertises websites hosted there, is sent by, and is 
done for the benefit of, companies based in the US.  The spam 
often appears to originate there because it's coming from open 
http, or squid proxy servers.  It's hosted there because these 
spammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.  One hardly 
needs to involve the Chinese government in a case where a US 
citizen is violating US law.

The first court cases were actually concluded years ago. These 
include many legal precedents which are used to protect the 
rights of ISPs to block mail, and to terminate service to 
spammers.

Surprising then, how much information you can find on the 
current whereabouts of long-time spammers like Alan Ralksy of 
Detroit, Michigan.  Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to 
the news media.  If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to 
him, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime 
candidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. 
Thomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard 
he'd been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his 
business partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You've 
heard of PopLaunch, right?)

Back when I was working at MAPS, there was a flap over a 
pump-and-dump spammer, Rodona Garst.  Seems she had an open 
file-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, 
the real owner hacked in and posted all her private information 
on a website. Oh, look, it's still there, including the nude 
photos:

I recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in 
confirming the validity of the information found online.  There 
were some "interesting" conversations. This summer, the SEC 
released the following:

http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm

Yes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty 
for operating a pump-and-dump scam isn't small.  The wheels of 
government grind slow, but the grind very fine indeed.
