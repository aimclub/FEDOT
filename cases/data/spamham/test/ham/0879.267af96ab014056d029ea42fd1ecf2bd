A flippant remark that I will probably regret  - sure there's assholes 
everywhere. I just remember a lunch in Spain with
a semi-famous American - I think we had about 10 nationalities at the 
table, and he managed to insult each of them within
15 minutes. A historical perspective makes me think that empires - 
Roman, British, Russian, American, whatever - produce
 a larger proportion of assholes than subject nations (and are more 
likely to have them in positions of authority).
