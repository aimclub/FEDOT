Great Village Voice story about oddball museums in New York. My favorite 
weird-ass museum is the Museo de Criminologia in San Jose, Costa Rica, which 
has bits of victims of famous crimes (machete-dented brain-pans, severed arms, 
etc) floating in formaldehyde jars. 

    A stone's throw away is the singular Freakatorium, El Museo Loco, a classy 
    treasure chest of curiosities belonging to sword swallower Johnny Fox, 
    whose focus is the rich history of America's earliest museums, from P.T. 
    Barnum's American Museum to the Bowery Dime Museums. The walrus penis bone 
    (other penis bones on display: coyote, mink, fox, raccoon) is enough to 
    make you feel you're getting your $5 worth. But then you spy the Jivaro 
    Shrunken Head (it's real, it's the size of a tennis ball); conjoined 
    piglets in a jar; an assload of taxidermy, including a gorgeous zebra head; 
    giant's rings...
