ehhh?  IANAHNBARHE -- RHL 8.0 is fully python-2, with a back
compatability v 1 shim set.  This has been working and freely
available in their Raw Hide for 5 months for early adopters
and back-porters.

Red Hat maintains binary compatability across major releases.  
Its server management tools are heavily Python, and becoming 
more so.

To have added mid-stream the python-2 series in the RHL 7.x
series would have been quite disruptive to an existing 
installed base.
