This is the headline of the month, possibly the year: "Doctors Grow Pig Teeth 
in Rat Intestines." Do we even need to read the story to understand it? It's 
like a freaking _haiku_ of near-singularity, future-shocky wonderment! 

    U.S. doctors said on Thursday they have managed to grow living pig teeth in 
    rats, a feat of biotechnology that experts said could spark a dental 
    revolution. 

    Researchers at Boston's Forsyth Institute said their successful experiment 
    suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could one day allow a 
    person to replace a lost tooth with an identical one grown from his or her 
    own cells. 

    "The ability to identify, isolate and propagate dental stem cells to use in 
    biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to revolutionize 
    dentistry," said Dominick DePaola, president and CEO of the institute that 
    focuses on oral and facial science.
