I think I could handle commenting out the lowest SPAM_PHRASE_XX_YY
scores.  If the GA could handle this sort of thing so they'd
automatically be zeroed, I'd feel better since the ranges could change
next time the phrase list is regenerated or the algorithm tweaked.

I think we need to understand why DATE_IN_PAST_48_96 is so low before
we remove it.  The two rules on either side perform quite well.

Okay, drop SUBJ_MISSING.

Probably a few, those seemed like the best prospects to me.

I only want a bugzilla ticket for each one if people are okay with
quick WONTFIX closes on the ones deemed unworthy of recovery.

If you could put the stats for each rule in the ticket somehow (should
be automatable with email at the very least), it would help.
