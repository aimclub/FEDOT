I need a lawyer willing to argue that not-for-profit file sharing is fair use. 
I've got a plan. 

Napster: Work in Progress[1] -- that's new. They're also selling merchandise. 

MP3 Is Not a Crime[2] is a weblog covering the attacks on our rights. 

Dave Winer says he's not afraid to defend our rights[3]. _Yes! Who else?_ 

I will now refer to file sharing networks as "fair use networks"
like my limewire fair use network client.. or the kazaa fair use network..
