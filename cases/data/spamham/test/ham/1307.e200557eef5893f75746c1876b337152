Hi,

This has been hashed over a few times on various lists, now I finally got 
around to doing something about it... You can now add
"rpm http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/ redhat/8.0 task" to your sources.list 
and after apt-get update you can find out what's available with 
'apt-cache search ^task-'

These are generated directly from comps.xml of RH8.0 so they contain 
exactly the same packages as you'll get by choosing the various categories 
at install time. I didn't bother including SRPMS for these as they are 
rather uninteresting, if you want you can re-generate the .specs by 
running http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/comps2task/comps2task.py.

BTW the repository only contains the task-packages, you'll need an 
apt-enabled mirror of RH8.0 in your sources.list to actually do anything 
with it.
