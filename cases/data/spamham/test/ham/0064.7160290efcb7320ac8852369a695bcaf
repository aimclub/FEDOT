hmmm.

Peter.

Open a terminal and as root type
lsmod
you want to find a module called
NVdriver.

If it isn't loaded then load it.
#insmod NVdriver.o
Oh and ensure you have this module loaded on boot.... else when you reboot
you might be in for a nasty surprise.

Once the kernel module is loaded

#vim /etc/X11/XF86Config

in the section marked
Driver I have "NeoMagic"
you need to have
Driver "nvidia"

Here is part of my XF86Config

Also note that using the card you are using you 'should' be able to safely
use the FbBpp 32 option .

Section "Module"
 Load  "extmod"
 Load  "xie"
 Load  "pex5"
 Load  "glx"
 SubSection "dri"    #You don't need to load this Peter.
  Option     "Mode" "666"
 EndSubSection
 Load  "dbe"
 Load  "record"
 Load  "xtrap"
 Load  "speedo"
 Load  "type1"
