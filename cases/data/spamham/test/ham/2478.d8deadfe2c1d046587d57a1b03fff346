Yahoo: The Case for Regime Change[1].



    

    Khatami asked the U.N. to set a deadline for Bush to step down in favor of 
    president-in-exile Al Gore the legitimate winner of the 2000 election, the 
    results of which were subverted through widespread voting irregularities 
    and intimidation.  

    [... This will likely require] a prolonged bombing campaign targeting major 
    U.S. cities and military installations, followed by a ground invasion led 
    by European forces. "Civilian casualties would likely be substantial," said 
    a French military analyst. "But the American people must be liberated from 
    tyranny." 

    [...] "Even before Bush, the American political system was a shambles," 
    said Prof. Salvatore Deluna of the University of Madrid. "Their 
    single-party plutocracy will have to be reshaped into true 
    parliamentary-style democracy. Moreover, the economy will have to be 
    retooled from its current military dictatorship model--in which a third of 
    the federal budget goes to arms, and taxes are paid almost exclusively by 
    the working class--to one in which basic human needs such as education and 
    poverty are addressed. Their infrastructure is a mess; they don't even have 
    a national passenger train system. Fixing a failed state of this size will 
    require many years."

    



Welcome news. The only way to crush America's fundamentalist tendencies is by 
showing them who's boss.
