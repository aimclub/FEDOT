also there's catdoc and wv for Word --> text conversions.  actually, wv
consists of wvWare, which as the manpage says "converts word documents
into other formats such as PS, PDF, HTML, LaTeX, DVI, ABW".  HTML would
probably be the best format for use with Plucker/SiteScooper, depending
on how good the DOC --> HTML conversion is.  i haven't used either in
over a year as AbiWord or OpenOffice work well enough.  (prefer AbiWord
for it's light-weight size, but OpenOffice has the better DOC importer.)

don't know which of these are better or worse than the other, but i
figure, "the more the merrier". ;-)

AbiWord supports exporting to PalmDoc (.pdb) which is about as
PalmOS-friendly as you can get.  never tried/needed it, but it's listed
there in the "Save As" dialog box.

Wine (or CrossOver Office, if you already have it) may support Word
Viewer (free download from Microsoft), but didn't a year or so ago when
i last tried.  Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert
Word 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &
paste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only
version of Word that i had.  anyways, a little nostalgia.

i have a windows (dual-boot) machine, but it only get used by my
significant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw.  (is there any
linux gui app that supports cdrecord's multi-session feature?)  since
OpenOffice, i've been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the
simple Word documents i receive from others).

anyways...
