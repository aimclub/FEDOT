More American exceptionalism:

and perhaps even irrespective of their
current citizenship:

I suppose it could be much worse;
there could be some twee affinity
program for US citizenship, and a
bank of phone people who only get
paid well if they manage to keep
one from cancelling membership...

To be fair, would this mean that they'd
also immediately pay out the difference
for anyone whose tax basis was greater
than current estate value?
