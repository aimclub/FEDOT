Sure it is - it tends to bring out the people who let "hysterical
right wing propaganda" spew forth, while reaching for their gun 
whenever a "liberal" enters the room.

my hysterical left wing "propaganda" is generally an emotional
reaction on a mailing list, not an organizaed attempt at converting
people's thinking through lies and distortion (as was the original
article). 

Whereas your constant and predictable brandings of my postings are, to
 my mind, a deliberate and reasoned  effort to reduce debate, and
 discourage left of center postngs.
