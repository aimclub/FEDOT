I'm reading this now as that you trained on about 220 spam and about 220
ham.  That's less than 10% of the sizes of the training sets I've been
using.  Please try an experiment:  train on 550 of each, and test once
against the other 550 of each.  Do that a few times making a random split
each time (it won't be long until you discover why directories of individual
files are a lot easier to work -- e.g., random.shuffle() makes this kind of
thing trivial for me).
