Sigh.

This sprung out of a report linked by Cindy about the promiscuity of
female monkeys with males other than the alpha male, i.e, specifically
not the tail end of the distribution.  "By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure [etc.]"

This has never happened.  Its relevance is nil.

So I chose not to type "on average" explicitly in my post, since this
is FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue.


There is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interested
in typical behaviour and you in extreme.  Actually, you probably just
had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it.


EOT, AFAIC.
