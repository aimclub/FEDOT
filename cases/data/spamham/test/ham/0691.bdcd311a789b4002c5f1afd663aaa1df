And, as always, you can take a page out of Fight Club and start showing up
at all sorts of support groups. Look what it did for Marla and Jack...

"JACK You can't have *both* parasites. You take blood parasites and --
MARLA I want brain parasites.
She opens another dryer and does the same thing again. PG 19
JACK Okay. I'll take blood parasites and I'll take organic brain dementia
and --
MARLA I want that.
JACK You can't have the whole brain!
MARLA So far, you have four and I have two!
JACK Well, then, take blood  parasites. Now, we each have three.
MARLA So, we each have three -- that's six. What  about the seventh day? I
want ascending bowel cancer.
JACK *I* want ascending bowel cancer.
MARLA That's your favorite, too? Tried to slip it by me, huh?
JACK We'll split it. You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
MARLA Deal."
