Sucks-Rules-O-Meter, and Jon Orwant wrote his own Sucks-Rules-O-Meter for
computer languages. Recently Dan Brian improved on that with a little bit
of natural language processing. Now [1]The Perl Review makes pretty
pictures of it all. Based on searches of AltaVista and Google, we found
that not a lot of people think PHP or Lisp sucks, a lot think C++ and
Java suck, and they put Perl is somewhere in the middle. Does Perl suck
more than it use to suck, or has PHP just shot way ahead?"
