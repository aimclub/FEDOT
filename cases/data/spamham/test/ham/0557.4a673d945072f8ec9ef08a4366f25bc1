Planning battle tactics; for this reason, the intelligence press
reports, spy satellites have had 1-meter resolution for many years.

Finding an individual vehicle in a city might occasionally be possible
with 1-m images and might occasionally also be worth the money.

For small areas you have legitimate access to, it's probably cheaper
to go there with a digital camera and a GPS and take some snapshots
from ground level.  Aerial photos might be cheaper for large areas,
areas where you're not allowed --- or, perhaps, physically able --- to
go, and cases where you don't have time to send a ground guy around
the whole area.
