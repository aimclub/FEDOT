Just to throw in another approach to solving the same problem. 

I run two copies of exmh, one at work, one at home.  They both
display on a "virtual X server" created by vncserver on the home
box.  I connect to that virtual X server using vncviewer wherever
I happen to be.  The VNC connection is tunneled over ssh and is
carried over the Internet via an IPSEC appliance.

That gives me access to both home and work email from either 
place without the complications involved in having two copies of 
exmh working on the same set of folders.

It's a tad slow viewing work email when I'm at work ... but not 
so bad that I can't stand it.
