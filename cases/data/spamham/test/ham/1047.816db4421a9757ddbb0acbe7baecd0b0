Well, I've used the check-the-modify-time cache trick for files in
many places (not just exmh) so some part of me certainly thinks it
is effective.  However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint
state, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the current
folder on every message read?  Perhaps we look at the sequences file
more than once per message view?  Just idle speculation - we can
stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are.

Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log.
We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 -
Tcl has had "clock seconds" (like gettimeofday) and "clock clicks"
(high resolution timer) for some time.  But in 8.3 we've calibrated
clock clicks values to microseconds.  It is still only useful for
relative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond
delta since the last log record.  Of course, we are measuring all
the overhead of taking the log record, etc.  I'll try it out.
