OOps, I didn't see the webpage get updated.  I saw the new claws, and
checked your site, forgot about it for half a day and then posted
here.  You beat me once again!

Oh yeah, I was following this thread in the sylpheed-claws list.  Very
interesting stuff.  I might have to stick w/ 0.8.2 until aspell gets
updated in Red Hat.
