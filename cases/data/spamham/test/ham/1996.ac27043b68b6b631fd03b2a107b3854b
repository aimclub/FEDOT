DVD Capture is an AppleScript for OS X that captures screen-grabs from DVDs. OS 
X normally disables screen-capture while the DVD player is running (even if it 
isn't visible!). I have some home movies on DVD that I'd love to get stills 
from, but I can't -- the DVD licensing board has forced Apple to break my 
hardware in such a way as to prevent me from doing something completely lawful, 
to make sure that I never, ever grab a frame out of _Police Academy n - 1_. 
Nice to see that independent software authors are willing to un-break my gear 
for me. Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Patrick[3]!_)
