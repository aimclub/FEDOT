Party(PDP).

My committee - The Niger Delta Development Corporation(NDDC)-which is in
charge of managing and supervising  the disbursement of oil sales revenues
for the Nigerian government.The revenues  under our control runs into
several hundred of millions of dollars monthly.My self and   
other colleagues in the NDDC are currently in need of a foreign partner
with whose bank account we shall transfer the sum of Forty Nine Million
Five Hundred Thosand United States Dollars($49.5m).This fund accrued to us
as commission for oil sales contracts handled under our supervision.

The fund is presently waiting in the Government Account named CBN/FGN
INDEPENDENT REVENUE account number 400-939134 with J.P.MORGAN CHASE
BANK,New York.You can do your independent verification of this. However,
by virtue of our  position as civil servants and members of the NDDC, we
cannot acquire this funds in our name. This is because as top civil

that we decide to use to siphon the funds through.
