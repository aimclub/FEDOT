Thanks to Jenny[1] for the pointer to this Yale Law article[2] about The 
Wayback Machine removing articles about Scientology. "While Lawmeme doesn't 
know all the details of Scientology's request to the Internet Archive, 
especially the extent of websites removed, we do know that the Internet Archive 
is blocking all archived versions of one of Scientology's leading critics and 
the main target in the Google Affair, Xenu.net."
