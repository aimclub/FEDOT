X-Spam-Level: 

As the subject line indicates, I'm sure these are stupid questions, but
I'm having trouble getting SA working like I understand it should work,
and have about given up on trying to figure it out myself.

If a user has a line like:

whitelist_from *@yahoogroups.com

in his .spamassassin/user_prefs file, does that line not, in effect,
tell the program to take no action at all against any mail coming in from
yahoogroups.com, or is there still checking being done against it?  And if
the latter, what does he need to place in user_prefs to cause such mail
to be ignored?  I'm testing SA here with a few users who happen to be on
yahoogroups lists, before deploying it system-wide, and although the above
line has been added to their user_prefs files, much of their list mail is
still going to the spam folder due to all the usual things you would
expect to trigger SA.

Thanks in advance for any help.
