lately I've got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower. I 
just decided to check that vs. reality, and yes, speed has left the 
scene somewhere between the release of 2.5 and now.

I checked on a number of small messages in a big folder (~10000 
msgs). The delay of the Next button has increased considerably:

2.5-release: 350-450 msec
latest cvs: 1000-12000 msec

Frankly I think this is getting close to non-acceptable since the 
user settings hasn't changed.

Anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared?
