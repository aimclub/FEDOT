Not really.  Try again?  About half the developers on the spambayes project
were missing some permission or other, so I ran thru all of them and checked
every damned box and clicked on every damn dropdown list I could find.  As
far as SF is concerned, you're all sitting on God's Right Hand now, so if it
still doesn't work I suggest you upgrade to Win98 <wink>.
