  | I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in
  | Text_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up
  | with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another
  | setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,
  | that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that.

I actually think you're looking in the wrong place.   I, at least,
have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or
selected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant,
which appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.

The problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY)
where it shouldn't - the previous selection should only be cleared
when there's something else to replace it (even if the highlighting
of what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom
application (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There
normally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary
selection (that is, set it to be a null string).

Then, because of the "if I get asked for the selection value, I will
find something" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert
point, the way most other GUI's operate), and then paste, because the
PRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing
else has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from
either the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was
deleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.

That behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.

Once that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal
"select stuff, click at new insert point, paste" mode of operation
that almost everyone expects to work (whether the "select stuff"
is somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).

ps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I've never
really understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that
part of the code and see how it all really operates.
