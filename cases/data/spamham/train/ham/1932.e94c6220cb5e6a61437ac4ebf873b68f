Finally finished up (most of) TRAMP, my RDF interface for Python. (If you don't 
use RDF or Python you can probably safely skip this entry.)  

New in this version: RDF library abstraction (because rdflib's organization 
currently sucks), write values in addition to reading, and unit tests, all with 
that old TRAMP flavor you've come to know and love.  

_But wait,_ it also comes with an entire page of explanation/advertisement[1] 
if you're not already convinced.



    RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal 
    with data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same 
    time? Need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? *
    TRAMP may or may not be the answer to these problems!*



Enjoy, and get a free bonus prize if you can tell me[2] why it's called TRAMP.
