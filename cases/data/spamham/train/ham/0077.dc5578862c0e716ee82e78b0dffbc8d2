Not true on the choice part.

After three weeks of me telling eircom that I did not in fact need nor want
their ?1800 worth of router and firewall
nor their onsite survey... for the uncapped service I actually managed to
get a 4 port modem (after asking for a 1 port modem) instead of ye olde
hardware router & firewall and eircom onsite.

I would have argued for the 1 port modem... (which I had asked for), but a
Director wanted the DSL up ... and fast....

Still it only took me three weeks to get (almost) what I
wanted....................................
