I think this is probably the best way, because I think (maybe) with upgrading you
do not always automatically get the latest feature enabled in some config file
because RH would rather take it easy and not update that config file (you get a
rpmnew instead of rpmsaved file) so they get less calls to support that way.

Anyway, I have tons of media files in /home/* probably 5 to 10 gigs at least, my
laptop's CDROM takes 700MB at a time (obviously) and compressing media files is
dumb because they are already compressed. Dumb question: how to backup huge data?
Network backup to another box? I do not have a box with a tape drive, but maybe box
with a large HD with much free space could take the backup (oops, I do not have a
space computer with a large HD with much free space).

These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! Yes I learned that
used CDs make inexpensive backup copy on the shelf. I do not want to re-rip all
this crap again.
