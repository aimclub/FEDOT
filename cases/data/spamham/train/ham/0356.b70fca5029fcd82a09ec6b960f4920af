Ran across a site which claimed to explain the original meaning of the
Ten Commandments.  It seems some of those meanings have evolved a bit,
too.

In particular, there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was
actually specifically about 'man stealing -- selling a free man into
slavery.  Certainly the US southerners were particularly sensitive to
the term 'man stealer' in a way I didn't understand.

Yep, I know he said all holy books.  No, I don't know if this site was
blowing hot air.  It just read like someone had done their homework.
