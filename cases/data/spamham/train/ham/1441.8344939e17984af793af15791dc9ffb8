As a new user of SA, I guess I'm having trouble connecting the dots.  If 
I understand you:  If I don't use the "nomime" => 1 option and I recieve 
MIME mail, the Mail::Internet modules become unavailable.

Unavailable for which?  MA?  SA?  What do these methods do?  Does this 
mean my incoming MIME mail won't be checked by SA unless I specify 
"nomime" => 1?

Thanks,
Phil
