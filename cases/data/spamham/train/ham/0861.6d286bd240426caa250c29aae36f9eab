I love this business.  If a bridge falls over, the architect or the
engineer is in court the next day, but when a /software/ bridge falls
over, we blame the air beneath it, or the phase of the moon, or
(more often) the people walking on it.

   "What idiots!  Don't they know you're supposed to walk on the
   /balls/ of your feet, not lead with your heels?  Didn't they read
   the blueprints?  They were posted in the town hall.  Any idiot
   would know the 0.75Hz heel cadence would pop rivets on the
   structural supports!  Geez. Pedestrians are /so/ stupid."

Ours is the /only/ industry that can hold itself 100% un-responsible
for any and all sloth-inflicted doom, and the only industry which can
/also/ get away with feeding this myth of infallibility unquestioned
to the media, to investors, to students and to each other.

   "God I hate telephones.  Telephones are stupid. I used a telephone
   to, like, call my broker yesterday, and y'know, just /after/ I'd
   ordered those 2000 shares of Nortel ..."

You just gotta love a mass-delusion like that.

Although it's like a total shock to 99.999% (5nines) of all the
employed website designers out there, the truth is webforms /can/
accept "U.S. of A" as a country.  Incredible, but true.  Web forms can
also accept /multiple/ or even /free-form/ telephone numbers and can
even be partitioned into manageable steps. All this can also be done
without selling exclusive rights to your wallet to the World's
Second-Richest Corporation (assuming Cisco is still #1) and vendor
locking your business into their "small transaction fee" tithe.

Of course, try and tell one of those 5-niners that and they'll get all
defensive, black list you as a sh*t disturber and undermine your
reputation with the boss...  not that I'm speaking first-hand or
anything ;)
