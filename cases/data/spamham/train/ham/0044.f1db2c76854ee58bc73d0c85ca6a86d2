Update on this for anyone that's interested, and because I like closed 
threads... nothing worse than an infinite while loop, is there?

I ended up formatting a floppy on my flatmate's (un-networked) P100 running 
FAT16 Win95, and mcopied the contents of the bootdisk across. Now I have a 
FAT16 Win98 install running alongside Slackware, and can play Metal Gear 
Solid when the mood takes me ;)
