she read the links. what must it be like, she wondered, to devote ones life
to pointing out  neighbors' mistakes, mishaps, inconsistencies and
frailties?

Hijacker High (8/30)
Dalal Mughrabi was a Palestinian woman who participated in a 1978 bus
hijacking in which 36 Israelis and an American nature photographer, Gail
Ruban, were killed. Mughrabi has a Palestinian high school named after
her, and it's apparently starting to show signs of wear. Fortunately,
the United States Agency for International Development has stepped in
with money to help renovate it.
