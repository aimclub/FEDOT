A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a 
short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex 
life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard 
from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. 

The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The 
card said nothing but "Maxwell House".  Mom was puzzled at first, but 
then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: "Good till 
the last drop." Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. 

The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, 
and the card read: "Benson & Hedges".  Mom now knew to go straight to 
her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 
"Extra Long, King Size".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still 
happy for her daughter. 

The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for 
a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a 
whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky 
handwriting were the words: "British Airways".  Mom took out her latest 
Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, 
and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: "Three times a 
day, seven days a week, both ways." 

Mom fainted.
