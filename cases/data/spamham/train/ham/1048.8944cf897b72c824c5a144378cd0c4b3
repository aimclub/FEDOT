As I'd written the code a few months ago, we were reading the sequences file 
first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence.  This 
happens anywhere that we look at sequences, most notably in Ftoc_ShowSequences.
That seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise, but I wanted my abstraction to 
have a separate call for "what sequences are in this folder?" and "what 
messages are in this sequence?".  One option would have been to add another 
call to get the data off of disk, but I felt that the check-the-modify-time 
technique would be less error-prone.

I think the biggest gains would be from augmenting Ftoc_ShowSequences to allow 
a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the 
current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences 
for all messages.  I described these thoughts in an email message yesterday.

And again, if it can wait a few weeks, I'm willing to do it.

Chris
