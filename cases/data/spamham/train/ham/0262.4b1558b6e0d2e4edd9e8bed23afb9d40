Here is what you do.

Remove all the PCI & ISA/EISA cards.
Remove the floppy disk cable from the mobo, the ide cables from the mobo...
essentially leaving only a video card... ram and a keyboard plugged in.

Turn on the system.
If it doesn't POST then, switch it off and remove the video card.

Switch it back on ... if your mobo doesn't emit some beeps complaining about
lack of video card then.

Switch it off.
Remove it's ram.

Same procedure as above.

If you still don't have any kind of mobo beep codes then you can try as a
last ditch effort to reseat the cpu... (remembering to never ever ever power
up your system without a heatsink & fan).

If after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes,
from it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and
no actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you
have power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu.

Once you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually
disjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST.
Power On Self Test.
