Dan Gillmor's column this week is all about Apple's burgeoning resistance to 
the Hollywood onslaught on general-purpose computing: 

    Intel's doing it. Advanced Micro Devices is doing it. Microsoft is doing 
    it. 

    Apple Computer isn't. 

    What's Apple not doing? It's not -- at least so far -- moving toward an 
    anti-customer embrace with Hollywood's movie studios and the other members 
    of the powerful entertainment cartel.
