Here's an interesting thing to test: discriminate words differently if
they are on a line that starts with `>' or, to catch styles like
above, that the first occurance on a line of < or > is > (to eliminate
html).

Then again, it may not be worth trying to un-false-positive that
Nigerian scam quote.
