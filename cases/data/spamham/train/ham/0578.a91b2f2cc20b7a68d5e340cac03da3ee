Did I claim "all gay people are hyperpromiscuous"? For what this is worth,
I would claim they're considerably more promiscuous on the average than
your average het. My utterly unscientific, unsubstatiated claim is that
the typical male would *like* to be considerably more promiscous than your
average female (ay, and here's the rub. pray don't forget the kleenex).  
Look up different reproduction strategies, due to basic hardware
difference (sexual dimorphism). You'd do that too if it happened to you.

Once you go past the first three of four pages of hysterical propaganda on
Google you might actually run into real studies. Anyone game? I have to 
work (well, pretend to).

This is getting better and better. You know 3K is utter shite how? You
just feel the number can't be right, yes? Deep inside? I'm way overposting
today, but I find this entire exchange hee-lay-rious.
