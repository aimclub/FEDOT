 Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail.

 Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make
solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with
solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to
other unixen like HPUX and SCO.

 Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One
of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,
they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software
problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.

 If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There
is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,
though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.

 You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,
who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,
that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.
