Thanks Matthias.  Actually I got all four speakers with subwoofer
working in digital out mode with gamixer.
(http://www1.tcnet.ne.jp/fmurata/linux/down/)

However switching between analog and digital, I'm still baffled.  As I
have a tuner and cassette deck hooked up to "Line In" on a SBLive! 5.1,
which is in analog mode.  But digital out works great now!

Sub : Finding out files larger than given size       LOST #324

To find out all files in a dir over a given size, try:
find /path/to/dir_of_file -type f -size +Nk
[Where N is a number like 1024 for 1mb, and multiples thereof]
