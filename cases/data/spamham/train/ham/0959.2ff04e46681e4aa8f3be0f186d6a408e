X-Spam-Level: 

I propose they rename it "Charlie Heston High" and maybe the students  
will learn to take AR-15s with extended military-spec scopes and .223  
high-velocity ammo and start plinking innocent civilians at random in  
the suburbs of Washington.  That's far more effectual than blowing  
oneself up in a bus.

In America these days, it seems that violence ascribed to any political  
doctrine foreign to Bushism is vile and repugnant.  But random violence  
is entertainment and intrigue.

A couple of ex-FBI "consultants" speaking on the shootings in DC were  
quoted as saying the shooters, presumed to be a pair, were getting a  
"heroin-like high" from each successful kill and that they "for  
whatever reason decided to level the playing field, thumbing their nose  
at law enforcement and society."

See?  Just a couple of kids having fun with Daddy's semi-automatic  
hunting rifle.  Harmless!
