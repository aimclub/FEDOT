Christ, you sound worse than me.

What I -said- in my post, John, was that instead of having to dole out
stupid refunds, I'd rather they save the costs incurred, knock off one
of those bullshit surcharges that they inevitably charge for promoting
services like these, and move on.  SOmething tells me, it'd balance
out.  Problem is, they're silly, they don't want to do this, and
rather than the legislation coming up with an affective means of
controlling the situation (overcharging) they impose silly
requirements like this.
