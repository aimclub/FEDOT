What a load of crap. Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I'd say that 
its considerably
clearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the 
common practice of
putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV 
cameras, visiting dignitaries,
etc, further exacerbating those feelings.
"Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies" is now usually done by police 
with riot gear and pepper spray.

We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably 
strayed from the permit area,
which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance 
ministers held here (the motorcade drove
by it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed,  beaten and 
arrested. Not very muddied at all.
