I apologize for not catching up to the current code in so long.

Now that I have I'm trying to resolve "breakage" and differences.

The unseen window seems to have been replaced with the sequences 
window.  While I appreciate the flexibility of the sequences 
window, the unseen window filled an important-to-me need:  It 
was tiny and could be set to show on all desktops of a virtual 
window manager without taking a lot of space.  Since my normal 
mode of operation involves two copies of exmh displaying on a 
1024x768 vnc session, screen space is at a premium.

As things stand now, I have a sequences window that shows a lot
more information than I need to have handy and takes up a lot 
more room than I can "spare".

I can see that I could like the new sequences window a lot for 
certain operations.  But I'd like a nice uncluttered, tiny 
window that _only_ shows me info on my unread mail.

One possibility that occurs to me would be a button or mouse
click that "shrinks" the Sequences window to show only the
sequences in the "always show" list.  And of course a way to 
expand it back.
