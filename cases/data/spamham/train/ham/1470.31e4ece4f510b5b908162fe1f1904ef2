SA (and other filters) could be configured to ignore the SWE mark if it 
appears to come from/through China.

SA could also be configured so that SWE marks are ignored in messages that 
look like third-party spam (like stock scams).  Of course, this would still 
mean that "The U.N. is going to invade America!" spams with SWE would get 
through.  Probably also need to ignore SWE in messages that look like 
Nigerian scams.
