"MIAMI, Sept. 10 -- A two-gram rock of crack
cocaine was found inside the shoe of Florida
Gov. Jeb Bush's 25-year-old daughter by workers
at the central Florida rehabilitation center
where she is undergoing court-ordered drug
treatment, Orlando police said today.

Noelle Bush was not arrested because witnesses
would not give sworn statements, but the
incident is under investigation, according to
Orlando police spokesman Orlando Rolon."

Wow, the witnesses would not nark of a Bush girl in an era where there are
no mare restrictions on being held without a cause?

Imagine that...
