_Sam Ruby_: Stark raving mad[1]. 

    This post was entered in Radio, extracted using a batch file via some 
    UserTalk, parsed using Perl, cleaned up by tidy and a C program of my own 
    design, transferred to intertwingly using scp, and then ssh triggers 
    unpacking on the destination site, where a shell script takes over: invokes 
    indexing using Jakarta's Lucene, and then a python script pings weblogs.com 
    and blo.gs. 

Tom Stoppard (_Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead_): 

    Guildenstern: &#8220;A man talking sense to himself is no madder than a man 
    talking nonsense not to himself.&#8221;
    Rosencrantz: &#8220;Or just as mad.&#8221;
    Guildenstern: &#8220;Or just as mad.&#8221;
    Rosencrantz: &#8220;And he does both.&#8221;
    Guildenstern: &#8220;So there you are.&#8221;
    Rosencrantz: &#8220;Stark raving sane.&#8221;
