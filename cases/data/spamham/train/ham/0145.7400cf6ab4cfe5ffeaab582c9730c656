I got the DSL-W 906E from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk.

Though it's not at all the best one around I have to say it does the job
and a bit. Some of the features can be a pain to get working (ie. pptp in
pppoe mode - can't figure it out). The documentation is not the best, but
the guys from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk will help you ouit. They
also have a message board.

The command line interface is quite powerful, but absolutely not
userfriendly.

All in all it's a cheap desent performer, that I am happy enough with.
Got this one including a microfilter (not needed) for 140euro including
shipping. Better than any deal from Eircom.
