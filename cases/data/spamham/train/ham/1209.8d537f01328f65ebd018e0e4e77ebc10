Curious.  I changed the arguments to Ftoc_ShowSequences to drop the folder 
argument and instead have an optional msgids argument.  Somehow your version 
of ScanFolder is still trying to pass $F.  You seem to have the latest 
ftoc.tcl (1.36), but not the latest scan.tcl (1.27).

I don't know how that happened, but try getting your source tree completely 
up to date.

Chris
