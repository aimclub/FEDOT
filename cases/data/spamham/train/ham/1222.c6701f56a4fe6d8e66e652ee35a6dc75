	When I do that, it just moves my mouse to the very edge of a window
(probably trying to center it on the off-screen window in question.) 

	I'll have to try it with another window manager and see if I can
get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries. I don't have this
problem with any other windows, though. Just the exmhunseen window.
