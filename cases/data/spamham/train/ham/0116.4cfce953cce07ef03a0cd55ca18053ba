Agreed, not much difference there. With C it just doesnt seem as wrong to
be crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit
_that_ big of a project into a 32K ROM, so large project issues dont matter
as much in the embedded world.

And in the realtime space, or when you have data coming in at 2Gbit/sec
[fibrechannel], every cycle DOES count.

Definately still very very true. C++ compilers are still a rarity.
