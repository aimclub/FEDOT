X-Spam-Level: 

I've had this binding in my ~/.exmh/exmhbindings for years:

set {bindings(key,Flist_FindUnseen 1 ; Inc_PresortFinish)} <Key-f>

After updating to the current code in CVS I get "bad key f" when 
I hit the "f" key.  I can open the Bindings... Commands window 
and define the binding.  It then works until I restart exmh.

I suspect a parsing problem/change.  I'll try to look into this 
tomorrow unless someone knows where the problem might be.
