I would appreciate it if you could get Gabber packages for Red Hat 8. I 
will be making a new release soon, but even in the meantime, 0.8.7 
packages would be ok.

I know that in the beta, red hat was using a modified version of 
gnome-libs which is incompatible with the latest gnomemm. If this is 
still the case in 8, I can send you a patch which makes gnomemm work 
again...
