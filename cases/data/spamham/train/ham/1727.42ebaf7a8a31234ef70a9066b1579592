Ah. In that case, you can use something considerably less powerful than 
VMWare. All you need is a machine configured to boot from CD-ROM and use 
a RAM disk for scratch space. Numerous Linux distros are available that 
let you boot a stateless but functional system from CD-ROM.

... but if you *do* want some state to persist, then you need a 
mountable writable partition. To protect it, you need some kind of 
access control management to decide who can do what to the writable 
partition, blah blah blah ... and before you know it, the security 
problem starts to look just like it does for conventional servers.

Simple approxmation to this: make /usr a separate partion, and mount it 
read-only:

    * The good news: attackers that want to trojan your software have to
      reboot, at least.
    * The bad news: administrators that want to update your software
      have to reboot, at least.
