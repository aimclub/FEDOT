SmartCards do not have fixed clock rates (more often than not) as the ISO spec 
dictates that they are externally powered and clocked, but SmartCards used 
for security purposes (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors 
that make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES 
faster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed.

That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael 
pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and 
attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again 
what we've seen is that it's not a question of "is it secure", it's a 
question of "who is it secure from and for how long?" Security is rarely a 
question of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather 
it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are 
designed to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the 
$1-20 range (depending on the application).

As whether or not they are "trusted hardware", the question again revolves 
around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student 
to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, 
say, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad 
EEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is 
likely "trustworthy" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect 
ICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, 
a risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question.
