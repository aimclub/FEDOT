Hi All,
I'm trying to set up the following:

1. A Linux server running with a modem for internet connectivity and an
ethernet card for LAN connectivity
2. Other LAN pcs with ethernet cards, using the Linux server for
DNS/DHCP etc.

Basically, I want to route any non LAN traffic through the ppp0.

I've got some of the way, but like a similar post earlier about modem
problems, when I am connected to the internet with eht0 up, the routing
is all incorrect and noting goes out through ppp0 (eh0 must be the
default route or something).

Is there standard "out of the box" Linux tools that will carry out
portmapping on behalf of the LAN PCs ?  (I'm planning on non routable
addresses 192.168.x.x for the LAN, routed outwards via the ppp0
interface).

Can someone point me at the right HOWTOs or routing documentation I need
to follow ? 
Thanks,
Dermot.
