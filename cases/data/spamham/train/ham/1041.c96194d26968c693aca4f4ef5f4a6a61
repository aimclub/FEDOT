*grin*  That's what the past 3 or 4 months of exmh hacking has been all about 
for me.

I've now stabilized everything pretty well for my paid job, so I'll probably 
poke around at the sequences performance issues, but rather than checking 
changes in, I'll email anything I figure out since I'm leaving town in less 
than 48 hours.
