  | Tell me what keystroke made it happen so I can reproduce it and I'll
  | see what I can do about it (or if I can't, I'll hand it off to Brent).

Don't worry too much about it, you seem to have plenty of other things
to do in the immediate future, and this one isn't so critical that people
can't use the code in normal ways.

But, to make it happen, type (with normal key bindings) any digit, so the
code thinks you're trying a message number, then backspace, so the digit
goes away, then '-' (other junk characters don't seem to have the
problem, I have just been playing).   That will do it (every time).

That is: 0 ^h -

Once you get into that state, the same traceback occurs for every
character you type, until a message is selected with the mouse.

This is looking like it might be easy to find and fix, so I'll take a
look at it later.
