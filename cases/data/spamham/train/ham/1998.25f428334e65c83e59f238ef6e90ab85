The Horror Writers of America are hosting a charity auction on eBay to raise 
money for American literacy charities. 

    Among the items up for auction: a rare softcover advance copy (bound 
    galley) of Thomas Harris' The Silence of the Lambs issued by St. Martin's 
    Press in 1988; the first U.S. hardcover edition of Clive Barker's The 
    Damnation Game; and a bundle of limited-edition prints depicting scenes 
    from Stephen King novels such as Carrie and The Shining.
