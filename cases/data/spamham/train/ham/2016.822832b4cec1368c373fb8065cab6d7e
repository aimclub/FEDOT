Great piece on the pulp comic characters that appear in the new series of Alan 
Moore's _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Tom Strong_ (thanks, Zed) funnybook. 
These characters, like The Terror and The Fighting Yank, are in the public 
domain because their original publishers didn't register (or renew, it's 
unclear) their copyright, which means that they've been granted a new lease on 
life in _Tom Strong_. The article segues into a very good discussion of the 
public domain. This was just Slashdotted, so it might be a little slow, but 
it's worth the wait. Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via /.[3]_)
