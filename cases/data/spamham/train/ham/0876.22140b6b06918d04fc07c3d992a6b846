Wishful thinking. People are just bigger dickheads now. Culture is changing
and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down
when you disagree with them.  The people that do this are NOT
disenfranchised. They
get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes. The act of protesting is
more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these
people.

And where does this end? Shouting down speakers is an obviously stupid
tactic if they are -really- interested in advocating change. Are they such
clueless social morons that they don't see this or are they just interested
in stroking their pathetic egos?

OBTW, 'clueless social moron syndrom' does not have political boundaries.
