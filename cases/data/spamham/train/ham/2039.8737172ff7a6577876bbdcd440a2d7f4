Some of the words in the new shorter Oxford English Dictionary: 

    Asylum seeker, economic migrant, bed-blocking, and stakeholder pension 
    reflect the serious side of life; bunny-hugger (a conservationist or animal 
    lover), chick flick (a film appealing to women), gearhead (a car 
    enthusiast), and Grinch (a spoilsport or killjoy) are entries in a more 
    light-hearted vein. Several entries are testaments to the popularity of 
    science fiction, among them Tardis from the TV series Doctor Who, Jedi from 
    Star Wars, and Klingon from Star Trek.
