This "more sophisticated than [Napster or Freenet]" part seems
to be the same behavior implemented in many other P2P CDNs, 
such as:

  - Kazaa
  - EDonkey/Overnet
  - BitTorrent
  - Gnutella (with HUGE extensions)
  - OnionNetworks WebRAID

...though the quality of the "digest" used by each system varies
wildly.
