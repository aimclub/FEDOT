Mark and I were two of many wonderful contributors to a new book from TechTV, 
called "The Catalog of Tomorrow." It's like a Whole Earth Catalog for 
futuristic technologies, with great illustrated spreads throughout -- you can 
get a peek inside at Amazon[1], and buy from Powell's or your other favorite 
indie store. Link[2] Discuss[3] (_Thanks, Andrew!_)
