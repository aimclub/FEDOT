Perhaps /cannot be heard in any other way (period)/ was incorrect.
What I meant, was a time-specific occurence.  Sure, there are other
means outside of the circumstance of the occurence. BUt until we're
willing to eliminate the ability to speak in public -only- for the
side that doesn't agree with the political force, and make that part
of the 1st amendment, the parties -are- screaming and shouting over
political figures because they cannot be heard (to those figures) in
any other way.

Sure.  And that goes back to my second argument -- Cohen.   THey can
walk away.   NObody compells them to stand there, I'll agree fully.
But we still have a Constitutional right to speak out against
policies, actions and grievances.

Again.  If you want it another way, lets change the Constitution.
