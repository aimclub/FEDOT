Alas, that's wrong. Both the drives are faster (10..15 krpm vs. ~7 krpm,
faster seek), and the EIDE protocol is ridiculously dumb (queing;
disconnect).

None of them are production quality. Right now only ext2 and ext3 qualify.  
It will take a good while (a year, or two) before we can trust anything
else.

Have you looked inside a dual-CPU 1U Dell? Three drives are easy to get 
in. Anything else would require a redesign, and would in nontrivial 
thermal engineering issues.

I can't think of a single major vendor who sells 1U systems with hardware
EIDE RAID.

I believe you that stuff can be found, if one is looking for it. However, 
I wouldn't put this into production unless I've had that system hanging in 
the local rack under simulated load for a half a year.
