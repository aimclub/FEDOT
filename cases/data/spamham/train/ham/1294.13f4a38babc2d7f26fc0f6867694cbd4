It might be, don't think anyone tried it yet.

Yes ;)

first off, redhat does not support upgrading from beta's to the released 
version.  That doesn't mean it can't work, it means nobody tried it, they 
sure didn't test it or fix anything to make it work, and you're on your 
own.

second, historically a new .0 numbers mostly means "so much has been 
changed that you might have problems upgrading from any previous release 
anyway".  So, historically, most users installing a .0 release do this 
from scratch anyway, doing upgrades throughout x.0->x.y.

If you want to avoid problems, bite the bullet and reinstall ;)
