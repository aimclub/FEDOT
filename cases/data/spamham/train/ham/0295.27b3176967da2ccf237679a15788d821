Getting your own domain needn't be expensive, looks more professional, and
you're not going to suddenly lose your site with little or no notice (yes,
I'm still smarting from bastard Geocities). I registered mine through
http://www.easyspace.com/ - works out about a pound a week for registration
and 30Mb hosting. It's a valuable service, there's no reason not to expect
to pay.
