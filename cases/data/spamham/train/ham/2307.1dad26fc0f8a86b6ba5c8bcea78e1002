Rendering polygons is not as easy as it used to be, the reason being the vast 
amount of different rendering techniques, methods and algorithms available. Not 
only is choosing the right ones a problem, even worse, all that are selected 
need to work together. There are some algorithms which simply do not work 
together, and in that case, only one may be used whilt the other one needs to 
be replaced witha more compatible method. This feature explores how Factor 5 
approached the problem when developing Rogue Leader for Gamecube.
