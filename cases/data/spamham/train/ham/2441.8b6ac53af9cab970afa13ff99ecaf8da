With project budgets in the multiple millions of dollars and virtually no 
margin for error, more and more development teams are under tremendous pressure 
to come out on top of the entertainment software market's cutthroat 
competition. No team manager wants to contemplate dropping the ball when 
creating the vivid graphics necessary to help make a game a success. Electronic 
Arts' The Sims franchise is an excellent example of this pressurized situation.

production needed for today's most demanding games.
