That explains...

Well, with 7.0, I've seen a few problems with doing that, but as of 7.2
it's really wonderful! Ever tried of completely uninstalling all openssh
related packages while being connected through ssh? Well, it works!!!! Of
course, if the connection cuts at that moment, you're stuck, but a simple
upgrade with official Red Hat packages also works like a charm :-)
