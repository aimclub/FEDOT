Hmmm, just as I thought.  In other words, it has no practical uses
whatsoever ;) ... do the biz guys in your office /really/ think WISPs
are really going to shell out /their/ money to find a house or two
they can't reach?  Experience suggests (a) they won't care and (b)
they will even sign up that errant house and then give them a
run-around blaming the dead-spot on "unsupported vendor equipment".

Thus, yes, it is 'cool': Expensive toy with no apparent function ;)
