I don't know whether it suggests that, but they would be tagged differently
in to/cc if I were tagging them at all right now.  If I were tagging To:
addresses, for example, the tokens would look like

    'to:email addr:mit'

instead of

    'email addr:mit'

as they appear when an email-like thingie is found in the body.  Whether
email addresses should be stuck in as one blob or split up as they are now
is something I haven't tested.
