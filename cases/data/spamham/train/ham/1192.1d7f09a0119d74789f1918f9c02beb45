Hi,

Just the kind of announce I make once in a while :
- I've rebuilt a new "alsaplayer" package based on Angle's one.
- I've rebuilt a hopefully final version "-fr8" of the "alsa-driver" and
  "alsa-kernel" packages which fix all known SMP build issues.

Both can be found here :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/

I've also repackaged gkrellm 2.0.2 with at last a separate package for the
server that can be installed standalone and doesn't even require glib2.
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/gkrellm/

Last but not least, my latest proftpd 1.2.6 package incorporates some nifty
new features : You can use any of "--with ldap", "--with mysql" and "--with
postgres" when rebuilding the source rpm with rpmbuild to enable desired
extra authentication methods and all package requirements are set
accordingly, and the release tag is changed too.
http://valhalla.freshrpms.net/ (the usual place ;-))

I think I'll use this "--with <whatever>" switch more and more where
possible. Some other of my package already use it like the xmame for its
output targets, sqlrelay for its modules and my latest sylpheed claws spec
to enable Pilot support.

As usual, feedback and comments are welcome! :-)

Matthias

PS: Yup, I'm back from my holidays ;-)
