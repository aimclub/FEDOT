Pro football players are addicted to football games, as a means of 
wish-fulfillment -- by "managing" the team, they can be free of the rule of 
their coaches and bosses. Maybe this explains the amazing success of The Sims, 
which, on the face of it, should be dull as hell: While away your free time 
away from the office by simulating an existence as a shlub with a day-job and a 
drive to acquire consumer goods on credit. You'd think it'd be the last thing 
you want to do. But it's not. When you're a Sim, you can tweak your existence a 
smidge, discover what life would be like if you took Path A instead of Path B, 
try the alternate universe on for size. The idea of football players playing 
themselves in licensed video games is neat and recursive, like the episode of 
the Simpsons when Mr. Burns runs into Krusty buying Krusty-O's at the 
supermarket and asks where he can find the "Burns-O's." 

    "It's always a trip," Carr says. "The first time I saw myself in a video 
    game was in college (at Fresno State) when I walked into a Best Buy store 
    and some kid was playing with me. That kind of trips you out a little bit." 
    

    For every 12-year-old kid who spends countless hours in front of a 
    television playing video games, there's a group of 300-pound offensive 
    linemen challenging each other at everything from Madden NFL 2003 to the 
    action-packed "Halo: Combat Evolved."
