Classic X copy-and-paste behavior is that you can only paste what is
currently highlighted.  In fact, it is the act of highlighting a
selection that actually copies that selection into the buffer.  X has
no "copy" command -- if you highlighted it, you just copied it.

If ab application has a "copy" command that you can choose to use
separately from the process of highlighting something, that command
is something the application authors wrote on their own.  (And it it
likely that an application that wrote an internal "copy" command would
also have their own customized "paste" command, to make sure the two
work together.)  Whether the internal (custom) select and paste
functions interoperate with the X server's global select and paste
functions will vary from program to program, because in each case you
are relying on the program's authors' efforts to blend separate systems.
