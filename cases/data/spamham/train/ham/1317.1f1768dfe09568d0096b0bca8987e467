	Me and my kernel rpm builds ... this all works along the same idea I have 
been aiming for, but the freaking RedHat Kernel srpms still have been stump 
...

	If we could get this and the alsa driver stuff working, it would be whole 
lot easier to try out a newer kernel ... but then the size of these rpms 
are huge, at least for us n^1 world courties ... ;-{ ...

	I will keep watching and hoping that somebody comes up with a great working 
idea ...

Thanks guys.
