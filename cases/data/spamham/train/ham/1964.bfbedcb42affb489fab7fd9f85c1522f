Google PR sends a message that they have a new News service[1]. Maybe I'm slow 
this morning, or maybe I'm spoiled, but what's the big deal. I thought they 
already had this. My personal aggregator[2] is better, it shows me what I'm 
interested in, it's not one size fits all. Help me figure this out. I'm sure 
there's something innovative here, I just don't see it.
