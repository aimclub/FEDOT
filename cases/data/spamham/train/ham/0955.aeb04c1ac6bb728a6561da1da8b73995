The structure of the Internet has never
been about where the ditches and ruts
are dug although the world needs
ditch diggers too.

It's a simple inductive concept:
You are you and see the world as such,
You plus 1 degree of separation is a new you.

All this stuff about scale-free Internets, viruses,
sex, and money is silly.  Scale-free statistically
indistinguishable models really means Internet-Scale
as rediscovered by social networks people.

I tend to prefer the Harvard Business Review
to the Economist as they tend to spend less
time writing about who's sleeping with whom and
come up with real statistical models.

Lies, Damn lies, and statistics.
