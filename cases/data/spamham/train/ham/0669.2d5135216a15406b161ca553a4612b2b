Because of this:
http://hrw.org/press/2002/08/yahoo080902.htm
there are several of us who are in the BDSM lifestyle who are trying to 
encourage our local groups to find alternatives to yahoo groups as a way 
of communicating with each other.  I've set up a place to have maillists 
on my server for any group who wants to use it, but I was wondering if 
anyone knows of an alternative that allows all the bells and whistles that 
yahoo has, such as reminders, file storage, calendars, etc.  Anyone?
TIA,
Cindy
