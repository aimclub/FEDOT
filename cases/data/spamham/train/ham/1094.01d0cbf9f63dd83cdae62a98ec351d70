  | 1) Right click on the folder label in the folder list

That (the way I have it configured, and it sounds as if the way Tony does
too) just does a move (rather than select as target without moving).

Of course, if you can manage to get no messages currently selected, then
it works fine.

  | 2) In the main window, the "+" key puts you into a "change 
  |    folder" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
  |    hit a second + and you go to "set a target" mode.  Type a few
  |    characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.

This works, but is not nice if you're not using the keyboard, but just
the mouse.

Tony: I agree - a nice way to link in one click would be good, and should
be easy to add, though currently adding mouse bindings (something like
shift right click would be a good choice) is much harder than adding
key bindings.

But note there's no need to "undo" - the way I generally use link, if
the desired destination folder isn't the current selected target, is
to right click on the target, which selects it and moves the message,
(and because I have the "automatic move to the next message on move or
link option set) select the message again, and then "Link".

Exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a
time, that is, one of delete, move, or link.   Selecting any of those
implicitly undoes any previous choice from the three (so you cannot
achieve a "move" by doing a link, then delete, then commit, it needs to
be link, commit, delete, commit).  (xmh was just the same there incidentally).

  | How's spring shaping up "down under"?

No meaningful comment from me, I'm not there at the minute.   But I'm told
that where I'm from it is cold, wet, and miserable, though has been better
during the day (sunny days, cold nights) for the past few.    In any case,
all of that is a good enough reason to stay away...
