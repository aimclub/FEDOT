DVDSynth is an open source project that allows you to splice in your own 
footage, alternate audio, subtitles, etc, to any DVD. This means that you can 
insert your own non-sucky subtitles, make and circulate edit-lists that make 
highlight reels for your favorite movies, etc, etc. It all amounts to a sweet 
tool for making the audience into the _former audience_, participants in 
entertainment. Of course, it's also illegal under the DMCA, since the tool also 
necessarily circumvents the copy-prevention in pre-recorded DVDs to accomplish 
its ends. Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via NTK[3]_)
