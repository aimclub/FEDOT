CMP, owners of [0]The Perl Journal, have brought the journal back, in the
form of an online monthly magazine, in PDF form. The subscription rate is
$12 a year. They need 3,000 subscriptions to move forward (no word if
existing subscriptions will be honored, or included in the 3,000).
[0]Read the site for more details.

I think some of the more interesting notes are that it will include "a
healthy dose of opinion", as well a broadening of coverage including
languages other than Perl (will this mean a name change?) and platforms
other than Unix (I'd always thought one of TPJ's strengths was that it
covered a wide variety of platforms).
