Yeesh.  Sounds like what you need is something to kick up once and score
an entire mailbox.

Wait a second...  So *that's* why you wanted -u.

If you can spare the memory, you might get better performance in this
case using the pickle store, since it only has to go to disk once (but
boy, does it ever go to disk!)  I can't think of anything obvious to
speed things up once it's all loaded into memory, though.  That's
profiler territory, and profiling is exactly the kind of optimization
I just said I wasn't going to do :)
