I think another venue for finding people is the workplace. As a contractor
I have had the opertunity to meet lots of eligables over the course of my
wandering workhistory.

My wife was my Task Order Manager years ago, thats  how we met. Her joke
is that she is still my Task Order Manager but now I dont get paid:)-

By starting up your own companies or working in sterile thinklabs you are
cutting yourself off from one heck of a fertile ground for linkages....the
common office.

I like the shurch idea as well. Other ideas...

Book circles, geocaching groups, heck Rhorho your still young enough to
hit the campus mixers...and I mean the social stuff not the techtech
events.


Above all, ask yourself whats important to you..

Life, you either life it or you waste it.
