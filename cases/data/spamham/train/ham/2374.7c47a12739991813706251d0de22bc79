The WSJ has published a round-up of phone companies, wired and wireless, 
ranking them based on performance and price. They don't mention Nextel, whose 
hullking milspec i700 handset I've been carrying for years now, with incredible 
reception all over the US and Canada. Their front-line customer service sucks, 
but the prices and network can't be beat. 

    T-Mobile is in the midst of a massive makeover. In recent months, the 
    company changed its name and launched an ad campaign featuring Ms. Zeta 
    Jones. 

    The company has a history worth hiding. T-Mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche 
    Telekom, is known for having a weak national network, and the FCC received 
    1,466 complaints about the company in the past year, giving it one of the 
    worst complaint rates in the industry. T-Mobile says their complaint rate 
    has tapered off and that they have made substantial network improvements. 

    But T-Mobile is the cheapest wireless provider, available, with an average 
    cost of just 8.2 cents per minute. (Verizon, by contrast, costs 14.3 cents 
    per minute.)
