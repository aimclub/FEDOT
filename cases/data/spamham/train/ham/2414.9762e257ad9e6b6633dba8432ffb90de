Modern Living is a series of about 100 tiny Flash animations that use 
recursions, gloomy music and simple interactivity to make inarticulate yet 
compelling existentialist morality plays. This stuff is like Philip K Dick 
rendered as a series of five-second interactive animations. I've just killed an 
entire hour on this thing, and now I want to go watch a Pinter play. Link[1]
