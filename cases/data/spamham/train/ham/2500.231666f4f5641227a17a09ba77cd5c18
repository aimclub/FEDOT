[IMG: http://www.konaweb.com/stick/left.jpg] I often carry my ukulele with me 
on planes. The case is so little it can fit in my suit case. I missed a great 
photo opportunity when I was in the airport a couple of weeks ago, and saw 
someone checking on a standup bass fiddle. It was in a huge plastic Darth Vader 
shipping case. The _buckles_ on the thing were about the size of my uke. I 
should have taken a picture of my uke and the bass side-by-side. Anyway, here's 
a stand-up bass that looks much more portable: the Kona Walkingstick. You still 
need to carry around an amp, though. Link[1] Discuss[2] _(Thanks, Prentiss[3]!)
