With project budgets in the multiple millions of dollars and virtually no 
margin for error, more and more development teams are under tremendous pressure

creating the vivid graphics necessary to help make a game a success. Electronic 
Arts' The Sims franchise is an excellent example of this pressurized situation. 
This article highlights the critical issues that govern the high volume asset 
production needed for today's most demanding games.
