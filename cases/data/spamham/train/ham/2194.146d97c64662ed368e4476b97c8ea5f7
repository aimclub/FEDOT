_Kevin Fanning_: Hallmark vs. Successories[1]. &#8220;At Successories you were 
mostly left alone. There'd be brainstorm meetings to come up with new topics to 
tackle ("Howsabout 'Diligence'?" "No I think we did that one already, didn't 
we?") but mostly you could just hang around, bang away at whatever ideas you 
had, show your manager what you were working on, and he/she'd give you 
feedback, encouragement, tell you to keep at it, point to the poster of 
Stick-to-it-iveness on their wall (Yes, we had our own brand of Successories 
posters hanging everywhere. I mean why not.) and give you the thumbs up.&#8221;
