_Paul Ford_: Falling Off a Truck[1]. &#8220;In the last 4 days I fell off a 
truck and was dragged for 30 feet, and was interviewed by an NPR show. Those 
two facts are not related except that they both happened to me and made me 
queasy. I also wrote a short plan outlining the rest of my life.&#8221;
