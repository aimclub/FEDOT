I've terminated a number of my own mailing lists at yahoogroups many
months ago because of similiar sentiments. I've tried lobbying other
people to move, but with about zero success.

I've got currently only one own mailing list there, which I'm going to
move as soon as it is technically possible (which is my ISP's problem,
basically). After that, I intend to kick yahoogroups for good.
