  | I vote for this being added to CVS, any objections?

No, but using PickMarkSeen (and pick(ids)) as an alternative to
just doing

	Seq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $results

seems unnecessary to me (that's all that PickMarkSeen does after all).
(That can be done via "busy")

Of course, the same is true of the badly named Pick_MarkSeen which has
nothing at all to do with "pick" except that it (ab)uses the pick(ids) var
in the same way.   (Its name would be hard to change unfortunately, as it
is known in app-defaults files for the "Catch Up Unseen" menu item, but
its implementation could certainly be fixed).
