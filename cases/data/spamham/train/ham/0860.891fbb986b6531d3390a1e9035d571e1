I'll agree that webforms are a pain in the ass, however it would seem to 
me that the problem with passport is the same one you noted with the 
autoform function, providing more info than you want to.  That and some 
entity would be holding the passport info, thus have all that data in the 
first place.
Personally i'd never trust them not to at least use it internally to 
market to me, if not sell/rent out.  Just think of the ability 
they'd have to build a profile for you since everything you went to was 
tracked to you.  And thats just the marketing side of it.
