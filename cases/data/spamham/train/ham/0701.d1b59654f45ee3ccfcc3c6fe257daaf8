Heh, ten years ago saying the exact same words was most definitely not 
"parroting the party line".

It was even less so thirty years ago. My story remains the same, take it 
or leave it. I've said the same words to white supremacists as to 
suburban leftist punks as to homeys as to French Irish, etc. etc.:

I don't have to agree with anything you say. I *am* obligated to defend 
to the death your right to say it. I don't give a rat's ass where you 
say it, even in France. I don't care where the political pendulum has 
swung currently.
