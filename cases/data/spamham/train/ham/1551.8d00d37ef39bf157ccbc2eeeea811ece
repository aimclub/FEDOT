X-Spam-Level: 

This is not directly SpamAssassin related, but more of a general
dealing-with-SPAM issue.

What is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction?
There are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the 'MAIL
FROM' and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I think
most people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a "permanent" error. That
pretty much means, "Don't bother to try from that address again,
you'll get the same error." People often add cathartic messages to
accompany the 550 like, "Spammers must die."

But this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers
that you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to
get around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail?
That is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but
then just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how
SpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP
transaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is
going fine and has no reason to try new methods.

Then there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code
indicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is
saying "mailbox does not exist." This would be in the hopes that some
spammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from
their lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can
lower the incidence.

So, what are the arguments for each? Do spammers even look at _any_ of
the bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must be
huge. Personally, I'm starting to think blackholes are the way to
go... But sending back that "Spammer die, die, die," or stock "Access
DEE-NIED!" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;)
