It was a extreme contrived example because you glosded over the 
point of the earlier 3-person example. 

But OK, Mr Math, let it be N men and women, for any N>2. They 
all pair off. Then, some number H, N>H>0, of men has sex with 
all the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with. 

Pick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice of
values results in meaningful differences between the sexes' 
"promiscuity", as commonly understood. It should be more 
obvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true 
for any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you.

Further, and I was hoping this would be clear without saying
so outright, this model actually approximates the cliche 
"common wisdom" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you 
reverse the male and female roles.

Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiple
partners -- men being "more promiscuous" than women -- and that 
surplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of 
hyperpromiscuous women (often derisively labelled "sluts").

Nope, now you've amended the meaning of your initial statement to
make it more defensible. What I objected to was:

Robert Harley:

# 
# Well, DUH!!!
# 
# It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,
# precisely identical between males and females.
# 
# Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.

If you assumed people on FoRK had a clue, would you have needed
to jump in with a patronizing "DUH!!"? 

If you were talking about fuzzy, typical behavior, would you have 
huffed and puffed with the words "perfectly obvious" and "exactly, 
precisely identical"? 

If your concern was with the "typical", why didn't you adopt the 
typical definition of "promiscuous", rather than a straw-man
definition which allowed you to interject "DUH!!" and mock an
anthrolopology professor's conclusions?

You are welcome to that theory!

But here's an alternate theory: when you jump in with a patronizing 
and overblown pronouncement -- e.g. "DUH!!... perfectly obvious... 
exactly, precisely identical..." -- and that pronouncement is 
itself sloppy and erroneous, then others may get a kick out of 
popping your balloon.
