I just updated to the latest CVS - I had been running a build from June.  
Hitting the Flist button gives the following traceback:

syntax error in expression "int(17+1+(222-)*(19-17-2)/(224-))"
    while executing

    (procedure "tkButtonUp" line 7)
    invoked from within
"tkButtonUp .fops.flist

    (command bound to event)


It seems to only happen in a folder with no unseen messages.

Chris, is this related to your recent changes?

Scott
