What I am specifically referring to is protesters shouting down speakers or
making so much noise that it interferes with the speaker. That's wrong,
immoral and unethical no matter what the political bent of the speakers and
the protesters. Rowdy protests in their own venue (on a college campus or
some of the commons areas of DC) is perfectly fine by me. Waving signs to
get attention is fine.

Well, Owen implied the protesters were arrested. Was he just jacking himself
off at the expense of other people? Exactly why is it a shame that they were
not arrested? Think about what you are saying and what you are telegraphing
about your state of mind here. You WANT people to do bad things (ie, police
arresting peaceful protesters) if it can help you further your cause? That
attitude just sucks. You have no moral ground to stand on if that is what
you believe.

Sure, just don't whine about getting arrested if you make it a point to get
in someone's face.

One other comment... Most of the people that are protesting against taking
out the Iraqi dictator wouldn't give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC.
They simply wouldn't care so why in the hell should the Americal public
listen to them on matters of national security?

So enlighten me, exactly why shouldn't Hussein be taken out? And if your
answr boils down to "i don't give a shit about what happens to the US", you
can kiss my ass :-)
