DNA's idea of fads is on the 100 kiloyear scale, unfortunately. As long as
current fads don't involve in-vivo rewrite of the genome, homeoboxes
including (now there's a problem for you, homeoboxing the adult), they're
not all that smart an idear.

Art is sure nice. However, if art is our first priority we're kinda

Our firmware is not built to be single-parented. You can counteract that
somewhat by exposing the kid to a community of close friends, but not too
many do that.

I don't know what exactly is wrong, but something is definitely wrong.  
This is way too important to be left to just our intuition of what is
right and what is wrong.
