Well, yes.  But it doesn't change the idea that the margin of survival
probably IS that thin in this region.

I'm not.  I'm sure both sides were equally ready to be the aggressor

1. Which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters.
2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.
3. US Leadership remains reflexively multi-cultural.
