That idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more (what
you sent doesn't support packages named "kernel-smp"). I'd also prefer a
cleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec...
probably "--define 'target 2.4.xx-xx' --with smp". Sound good enough?
The BuildRequires on "kernel-source" will also need to be removed because
it won't necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/

More ideas are welcome.
