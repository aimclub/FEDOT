Read the article.  I'm afraid I don't understand how the transmission
prices could have hit $50/tcf.

But I'm also really leery of telling a pipeline company they have to run
a pipeline at a higher pressure and that they should forego maintenance.
We had a big pipeline explosion up here awhile ago.

So maybe the judge has a point.  We'll see as the appeals work its way
out.
