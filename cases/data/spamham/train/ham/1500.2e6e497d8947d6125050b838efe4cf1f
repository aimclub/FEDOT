If you need to store a database password, then
clearly the first step is to store the text outside the
web tree.  You can encrypt it and store the encryption key elsewhere,
so that at least an attacker has to get two different things.
Also, don't get full privileges - create a user account that
is GRANTed very limited access.

However, you can often do better than this if security
is critical.  Create a separate program which has these
database keys (as noted above), and make the web program
contact IT.  Create a very limited protocol that ONLY
lets you do the operations you need (you can add specific
operations later).  There's a performance hit, which you're
trading for improved data isolation.
