**FEDOT** is an open-source framework for automated modeling and machine learning (AutoML) problems. This framework is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

It provides automatic generative design of machine learning pipelines for various real-world problems. The core of FEDOT is based on an evolutionary approach and supports classification (binary and multiclass), regression, clustering, and time series prediction problems.

The key feature of the framework is the complex management of interactions between various blocks of pipelines. It is represented as a graph that defines connections between data preprocessing and model blocks.

The project is maintained by the research team of the Natural Systems Simulation Lab, which is a part of the `National Center for Cognitive Research of ITMO University <https://actcognitive.org/>`__.

More details about FEDOT are available in the next video:

FEDOT concepts
==============

- **Flexibility.** FEDOT can be used to automate the construction of solutions for various `problems <https://fedot.readthedocs.io/en/master/introduction/fedot_features/main_features.html#involved-tasks>`_, `data types <https://fedot.readthedocs.io/en/master/introduction/fedot_features/automation_features.html#data-nature>`_ (texts, images, tables), and `models <https://fedot.readthedocs.io/en/master/advanced/automated_pipelines_design.html>`_;
- **Extensibility.** Pipeline optimization algorithms are data- and task-independent, yet you can use `special strategies <https://fedot.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/strategies.html>`_ for specific tasks or data types (time-series forecasting, NLP, tabular data, etc.) to increase the efficiency;
- **Integrability.** FEDOT supports widely used ML libraries (Scikit-learn, CatBoost, XGBoost, etc.) and allows you to integrate `custom ones <https://fedot.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/strategies.html#module-fedot.core.operations.evaluation.custom>`_;
- **Tuningability.** Various `hyper-parameters tuning methods <https://fedot.readthedocs.io/en/master/advanced/hyperparameters_tuning.html>`_ are supported including models' custom evaluation metrics and search spaces;
- **Versatility.** FEDOT is `not limited to specific modeling tasks <https://fedot.readthedocs.io/en/master/advanced/architecture.html>`_, for example, it can be used in ODE or PDE;
- **Reproducibility.** Resulting pipelines can be `exported separately as JSON <https://fedot.readthedocs.io/en/master/advanced/pipeline_import_export.html>`_ or `together with your input data as ZIP archive <https://fedot.readthedocs.io/en/master/advanced/project_import_export.html>`_ for experiments reproducibility;
- **Customizability.** FEDOT allows `managing models complexity <https://fedot.readthedocs.io/en/master/introduction/fedot_features/automation_features.html#models-used>`_ and thereby achieving desired quality.

Installation
============

- Package installer for Python **pip**

The simplest way to install FEDOT is using ``pip``:

.. code-block::

  $ pip install fedot

Installation with optional dependencies for image and text processing, and for DNNs:

.. code-block::

  $ pip install fedot[extra]

- **Docker** container

Available docker images can be found here `here <https://github.com/aimclub/FEDOT/tree/master/docker/README_en.rst>`_.

How to Use
==========

FEDOT provides a high-level API that allows you to use its capabilities in a simple way. The API can be used for classification, regression, and time series forecasting problems.

To use the API, follow these steps:

1. Import ``Fedot`` class

.. code-block:: python

 from fedot.api.main import Fedot

2. Initialize the Fedot object and define the type of modeling problem. It provides a fit/predict interface:

- ``Fedot.fit()`` begins the optimization and returns the resulting composite pipeline;
- ``Fedot.predict()`` predicts target values for the given input data using an already fitted pipeline;
- ``Fedot.get_metrics()`` estimates the quality of predictions using selected metrics.

NumPy arrays, Pandas DataFrames, and the file's path can be used as sources of input data. In the case below, ``x_train``, ``y_train`` and ``x_test`` are ``numpy.ndarray()``:

.. code-block:: python

    model = Fedot(problem='classification', timeout=5, preset='best_quality', n_jobs=-1)
    model.fit(features=x_train, target=y_train)
    prediction = model.predict(features=x_test)
    metrics = model.get_metrics(target=y_test)

More information about the API is available in the `documentation <https://fedot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/api.html>`__ section and advanced approaches are in the `advanced <https://github.com/aimclub/FEDOT/tree/master/examples/advanced>`__ section.
