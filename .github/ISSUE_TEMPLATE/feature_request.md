<!--
  Hi! Thanks for considering to file a feature request with Fedot. Please take the time to
  answer the basic questions. Please try to be as detailed as possible.

  Thanks!
-->

## Summary

<!--
  A one-paragraph explanation of the feature.
-->

## Motivation

<!--
  Why do you want to see this feature in Fedot? What use cases does it support?
-->

## Guide-level explanation

<!--
  Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the project and you
  were teaching it to another programmer. That generally means:

  - Introducing new named concepts.
  - Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
  - If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or
    migration guidance.

  If this is a small feature, you may omit this section.
-->

## Reference-level explanation

<!--
  This is the technical portion of the feature request. Explain the design in
  sufficient detail that:

  - Its interaction with other features is clear.
  - It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
  - Corner cases are dissected by example.

  If you do not know how to answer this, you can omit it. No worries!
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
  Why should we *not* do this?
-->

## Unresolved Questions

<!--
  What related issues do you consider out of scope for this feature that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  feature?
-->
